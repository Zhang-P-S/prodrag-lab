This framing implicitly treats all\nerrors as equally severe, despite growing evidence that hallucinated medical content varies widely\nin potential harm ((Wu et al., 2024)).\nIn clinical and safety-critical settings, the impact of hallucinated content often depends less on\nwhether it is factually correct and more on whether it is actionable. For example, unsupported\ntreatment directives, contraindications, or urgency cues may lead to harmful outcomes if followed,\nwhereas benign factual inaccuracies may pose little immediate risk. Recent clinical safety analy-\nses and clinician-annotated studies emphasize that such distinctions are essential for evaluating the\nreal-world safety of medical language models (Zhang et al., 2023; Lehman et al., 2023). However,\nexisting hallucination benchmarks and automatic metrics do not explicitly capture these differences\nin risk.\nThis gap raises a fundamental evaluation question: are current hallucination metrics aligned with\nclinical risk? As noted in recent surveys, hallucination detection and labeling are highly subjective,\ntask-dependent, and sensitive to prompt design, particularly in domains where no single “correct”\nanswer exists (Ji et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024). In patient-facing medical QA, where models act as\nassistants rather than decision-makers, evaluating hallucinations purely by correctness may obscure\nsafety-critical failure modes.\n1\narXiv:2602.07319v1  [cs.CL]  7 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nIn this work, we propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework for hallucinations in patient-facing\nmedical question answering. Rather than attempting to detect hallucinations or assess clinical cor-\nrectness, we evaluate model outputs through the presence of risk-bearing medical language, in-\ncluding treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, dosage expressions, and mentions\nof high-risk medications. These language patterns are widely recognized as safety-critical when\nunsupported, regardless of factual accuracy (Institute for Safe Medication Practices, 2022; Ayers\net al., 2023). We formalize this perspective through a continuous Risk-Sensitive Hallucination Score\n(RSHS) that quantifies both the frequency and severity of such signals.\nBecause risk-bearing language alone does not fully characterize harmful failures, we further incor-\nporate a relevance measure between the patient query and the model response. High-risk language\nthat is weakly grounded in the user’s input represents a particularly concerning class of failures\nthat standard metrics fail to capture. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using controlled\npatient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests and evaluate three instruction-tuned language\nmodels from the same model family. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behav-\nior exhibit substantially different risk profiles, and that evaluation validity depends critically on task\nand prompt design.\n2\nRISK-SENSITIVE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK\n2.1\nFROM HALLUCINATION PRESENCE TO HALLUCINATION RISK\nPrior work on medical hallucinations has primarily operationalized hallucination as factual incor-\nrectness or unsupported content relative to a reference answer or source document (e.g., (Zhu et al.,\n2025)). While this definition is appropriate for benchmarking correctness, it does not capture dif-\nferences in clinical impact. As noted in recent surveys and clinician-facing studies, hallucinations\nthat include treatment directives, contraindications, or urgency cues may pose substantially higher\nrisk than benign factual errors, even when both are technically incorrect (Zhu et al., 2025; Wu et al.,\n2024).\nMotivated by this observation, we adopt a risk-sensitive perspective on hallucination evaluation.\nRather than attempting to label hallucinations or assess medical correctness—tasks that require ex-\npert annotation and exhibit substantial inter-annotator disagreement (Wu et al., 2024)—we evaluate\nmodel outputs through the presence of risk-bearing medical language. This framing aligns with\nprior clinical safety analyses that emphasize the potential consequences of model outputs over their\nsurface accuracy (Zhang et al., 2023; Lehman et al., 2023).\nFormally, given a patient query q and a model-generated response x, our goal is not to determine\nwhether x is correct, but to quantify whether x contains language that could plausibly lead to harm\nif acted upon.\n2.2\nRISK-BEARING LANGUAGE CATEGORIES\nWe define a set of risk-bearing language categories that have been widely identified as safety-critical\nin medical NLP and clinical decision support literature:\n• Treatment directives: instructions to start, stop, increase, or adjust medications or thera-\npies.\n• Contraindications and prohibitions: statements asserting that an action or medication\nshould not be taken.\n• Dosage expressions: explicit quantities, schedules, or dose adjustments.\n• Urgency and triage cues: recommendations to seek emergency care, urgent evaluation,\nor, conversely, to avoid medical care.\n• High-alert medications: mentions of medications associated with elevated risk, such as\nanticoagulants or insulin.\n• Overconfident assertions: language that indicates certainty in the absence of supporting\ncontext.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nThese categories reflect consensus safety concerns rather than task-specific annotation schemes and\nare consistent with prior analyses of harmful medical model behavior (ISMP, 2022; Ayers et al.,\n2023). Importantly, the presence of such language is treated as a risk signal, not as evidence of\nincorrect or inappropriate advice.\n2.3\nRISK-SENSITIVE HALLUCINATION SCORE\nWe operationalize risk-bearing hallucinations through a continuous Risk-Sensitive Hallucination\nScore (RSHS) that aggregates the presence and severity of safety-critical medical language in a\nmodel-generated response. Let C = {c1, . . . , cK} denote a set of risk-bearing language categories,\nsuch as treatment directives or urgency cues. For a response x, each category ck comprises a collec-\ntion of surface patterns (e.g., keywords or short phrases) associated with that risk type.\nRather than assigning a single weight per category, we associate each pattern p within category ck\nwith a pattern-specific weight wk,p that reflects ordinal differences in potential harm. For example,\nwithin the triage category, explicit discouragement of seeking medical care is treated as higher risk\nthan general urgency cues, while within treatment directives, explicit dosage changes are treated\nas higher risk than general medication mentions. These weights are manually specified based on\nclinical safety considerations and prior literature, and are intended to encode relative severity rather\nthan calibrated estimates of harm.\nFormally, let Pk denote the set of patterns associated with category ck, and let ·n(p, x) indicate\nwhether pattern p appears in response x. The RSHS for response x is defined as:\nRSHS(x) =\nPK\nk=1\nP\np∈Pk wk,p · n(p, x)\n1 + log(1 + |x|)\n,\n(1)\nwhere |x| denotes the token length of the response. The logarithmic normalization mitigates bias\ntoward longer generations and ensures that RSHS reflects concentration of risk-bearing language\nrather than verbosity.\nRSHS is intended as a comparative evaluation signal rather than a deployment threshold or halluci-\nnation detector. It does not assess medical correctness or appropriateness, and higher scores indicate\nonly greater presence of risk-bearing language under the evaluation conditions considered.\n2.4\nRISK × RELEVANCE ANALYSIS\nRisk-bearing language alone does not fully characterize harmful failures. A response may include\nurgency or treatment language while remaining well-grounded in the patient query, or it may issue\ndirectives that are weakly related or entirely irrelevant. Prior work has shown that semantic drift and\nloss of grounding are common failure modes in long-form LLM generation (Ji et al., 2023).\nTo capture this distinction, we complement RSHS with a query–response relevance score, computed\nas the cosine similarity between sentence embeddings of the patient query and the model response.\nWe refer to this measure as QASim.\nBy jointly analyzing RSHS and QASim, we identify a particularly concerning class of failures:\nresponses that exhibit high risk and low relevance, corresponding to risk-bearing language that is\nweakly grounded in the user’s input. As we show in Section 3, this joint analysis reveals failure\nmodes that are not apparent when considering risk or relevance in isolation.\n2.5\nSCOPE AND INTENDED USE\nWe emphasize that this framework is designed for evaluation, not deployment. RSHS does not\nassess medical correctness, appropriateness, or patient outcomes, nor does it replace clinician review.\nInstead, it serves as a diagnostic tool for comparing model behaviors, probing safety-critical prompt\nconditions, and assessing whether evaluation metrics meaningfully reflect differences in potential\nharm. This scope is consistent with recent calls for more nuanced hallucination evaluation in both\nmedical and general-domain LLMs (Zhu et al., 2025; Ji et al., 2023).\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nModel\nTreat.\nContra.\nUrgency\nDose\nHigh-Risk\nOverconf.\nFLAN-T5-small\n0.135\n0.275\n0.005\n0.000\n0.005\n0.000\nFLAN-T5-base\n0.025\n0.070\n0.020\n0.000\n0.015\n0.000\nFLAN-T5-large\n0.310\n0.030\n0.335\n0.000\n0.010\n0.00\nTable 1: Fraction of responses containing at least one instance of each risk-bearing language cate-\ngory across FLAN-T5 models. Differences are primarily driven by treatment directives and urgency\ncues, while explicit dosage expressions remain rare across all models.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS\n3.1\nPATIENT-FACING PROMPT DESIGN\nTo evaluate hallucinations under safety-critical conditions, we construct a set of patient-facing med-\nical prompts designed as controlled stress tests. Rather than modeling real clinical encounters, these\nprompts are intended to elicit situations in which language models may generate unsupported but\nactionable medical language, such as treatment directives or urgency cues.\nPrompts are generated using lightweight templates covering common patient concerns, including\nsymptom triage, medication management, pregnancy-related questions, and chronic disease scenar-\nios. Each prompt is phrased from the perspective of a patient seeking guidance (e.g., “My blood\npressure is 170/100. Should I take extra medication?”). This design follows prior safety evalua-\ntions that use synthetic inputs to probe model behavior under uncertainty without requiring clinical\nground truth (Ji et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023).\nUnless otherwise specified, we evaluate on 200 distinct prompts.\n3.2\nMODELS\nWe evaluate three instruction-tuned sequence-to-sequence language models from the same architec-\ntural family: FLAN-T5-small, FLAN-T5-base, and FLAN-T5-large. Using a single model family\nisolates the effect of model scale while controlling for training paradigm and instruction tuning.\nAll models are prompted with identical instructions encouraging helpful responses and allowing\nmention of management considerations when relevant. Generation is performed using nucleus sam-\npling with fixed temperature to expose variability in model behavior.\n3.3\nEVALUATION METRICS\nWe report two complementary evaluation signals. First, we compute the Risk-Sensitive Halluci-\nnation Score (RSHS) defined in Section 2, which quantifies the presence of risk-bearing medical\nlanguage such as treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-alert\nmedications. Higher RSHS indicates greater potential risk if the response were acted upon.\nSecond, we compute a query–response relevance score (QASim) using cosine similarity between\nsentence embeddings of the patient query and the model response. This measure captures semantic\ngrounding and is used to identify high-risk responses that are weakly related to the user input.\nWe emphasize that neither metric assesses clinical correctness; both are used solely for evaluation\nand comparison of model behavior.\n3.4\nOVERALL RISK PROFILES\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of RSHS values across models. While all models frequently gener-\nate low-risk responses, we observe clear differences in tail behavior. Larger models exhibit higher\nupper-percentile RSHS values, indicating a greater tendency to produce risk-bearing language,\nwhereas smaller models show fewer but occasionally more extreme failures.\nAcross prompts, We observe systematic differences in mean and upper-tail RSHS across model\nscales. These differences are not captured by standard surface-level metrics, which treat all re-\nsponses equivalently.\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nFigure 1: Distribution of Risk-Sensitive Hallucination Scores (RSHS) across three instruction-tuned\nmodels on 200 patient-facing prompts. Higher values indicate more risk-bearing medical language.\nDifferences are most pronounced in the upper tail, suggesting model-dependent variation in risk-\nbearing generations.\n3.5\nRISK CATEGORY ANALYSIS\nTo better understand the sources of risk, we analyze the frequency of risk-bearing language cate-\ngories. Differences across models are primarily driven by treatment directives (e.g., “start,” “stop,”\n“increase”) and urgency cues (e.g., “go to the emergency room”). Explicit dosage expressions are\nrare across all models.\nThis analysis suggests that model scale affects not only response length but also willingness to issue\nactionable guidance, consistent with observations in prior medical safety studies (Ayers et al., 2023;\nWu et al., 2024).\n3.6\nRISK–RELEVANCE FAILURE MODES\nFigure 2 plots RSHS against QASim for all responses. Most high-risk responses remain moderately\nrelevant to the patient query. However, a small number of responses exhibit both high risk and low\nrelevance, corresponding to unsupported directives or urgency cues that are weakly grounded in the\ninput.\nQualitative inspection reveals distinct failure modes across models. Smaller models occasionally\nproduce off-topic or nonsensical responses containing risk-bearing language, while larger models\nmore often generate coherent but overly prescriptive guidance. These differences highlight the im-\nportance of jointly evaluating risk and relevance when assessing hallucinations in patient-facing\nsettings.\n3.7\nPROMPT SENSITIVITY\nFinally, we evaluate sensitivity to prompt framing by comparing neutral prompts against prompts\nthat explicitly invite management considerations. Risk-sensitive scores increase substantially under\nmanagement-oriented prompts, with amplification effects varying by model size. This result demon-\nstrates that hallucination risk is highly task- and prompt-dependent, and that evaluation metrics must\naccount for such conditions to remain meaningful.\n3.8\nEXTENSION TO DECODER-ONLY MODELS\nWe additionally evaluate Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, a decoder-only instruction-tuned model, using the\nsame prompts and identical risk-sensitive evaluation pipeline. Phi-3 exhibits a mean RSHS of 0.36\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nFigure 2: Risk–relevance analysis of model responses. Each point represents a patient-facing re-\nsponse, plotted by its Risk-Sensitive Hallucination Score (RSHS) and query–response relevance\n(QASim). While many high-risk responses remain semantically aligned with the input, a subset ex-\nhibits elevated risk and weak relevance, corresponding to unsupported or weakly grounded medical\nadvice.\nwith pronounced upper-tail behavior (90th percentile 0.98), driven primarily by treatment directives\nand urgency cues.\nDue to architectural and safety-tuning differences, these results are not intended as direct perfor-\nmance comparisons. Instead, they demonstrate that the proposed risk-sensitive evaluation frame-\nwork generalizes beyond a single model family and continues to surface meaningful variation in\nrisk-bearing language.\n4\nDISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS\nOur results highlight several implications for hallucination evaluation in patient-facing medical set-\ntings. First, we find that hallucinations differ substantially in potential risk, and that treating all\nerrors as equally severe obscures meaningful differences in model behavior. Models with similar\nsurface-level performance exhibit distinct risk profiles, particularly in the upper tail of risk-bearing\nlanguage. This suggests that evaluation metrics focused solely on correctness or fluency may be\ninsufficient for assessing safety in real-world deployments.\nSecond, our analysis demonstrates that hallucination risk is highly dependent on task and prompt\nframing. Prompts that invite management or urgency considerations substantially increase the preva-\nlence of risk-bearing language, revealing failure modes that are largely invisible under neutral eval-\nuation conditions. This observation underscores the importance of evaluation validity: metrics must\nbe applied under conditions that reflect how models are actually used.\nThird, combining risk sensitivity with relevance provides additional diagnostic value. While many\nhigh-risk responses remain semantically aligned with the user query, a small but concerning subset\nexhibits both elevated risk and weak grounding. These failures correspond to unsupported or off-\ntopic medical advice and are not captured by risk or relevance measures in isolation.\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026\nThis work has several limitations. We do not assess clinical correctness, appropriateness, or patient\noutcomes, nor do we claim to detect hallucinations directly. Risk-bearing language is identified\nusing pattern-based heuristics, which may miss subtle forms of unsafe guidance or overestimate\nrisk in benign contexts. Additionally, our prompts are synthetic stress tests rather than real clinical\nencounters, and our findings should not be interpreted as reflecting deployment-ready behavior.\nDespite these limitations, we view risk-sensitive evaluation as a complementary tool to existing\nbenchmarks and clinician-annotated studies. By focusing on potential impact rather than factual\naccuracy alone, our framework provides a lightweight and interpretable signal for comparing mod-\nels and probing safety- critical behaviors. We hope this perspective encourages further work on\nevaluation methods that better align hallucination metrics with real-world risk.\nLarge language models were used to assist with code refactoring, experimental debugging, and\nminor text editing during the preparation of this manuscript.
