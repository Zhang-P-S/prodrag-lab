We use this mining to benchmark a variety of LLM\nmodels for differential diagnosis. of rare diseases\nrate diagnosis remains difficult due to the vast diver-\nsity and sparsity of these conditions (Auvin et al.,\n2018). Large language models (LLMs) are being ac-\ntively explored for differential diagnosis due to their\nwide-recall abilities (McDuff et al., 2025a), leading\nto a plethora of work on LLM-based rare disease dif-\nferential diagnosis. These approaches range from ex-\nploring large frontier models (Ao et al., 2025; Chen\net al., 2024) to smaller agentic systems (Chen et al.,\n2025).\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from several\ndrawbacks.\nStudies by Ao et al. (2025) and Chen\net al. (2024) focus purely on cleanly-curated clini-\ncal case studies with patient profiles that can differ\nvastly from typical clinical settings, such as those\nfound in clinical notes from MIMIC-IV (Johnson\net al., 2023b,a). Meanwhile, Chen et al. (2025) use\nICD codes as a proxy for rare disease classification.\nWhile efforts have been made to map ICD codes to\nmore granular rare disease Orphanet codes (Cavero-\nCarbonell et al., 2020), over 50% of Orphanet codes\nlack direct mappings, resulting in under-reporting of\nrare diseases within ICD-annotated systems.\nTo ensure better coverage, it is crucial to directly\nmine rare diseases from clinical notes and map them\nto specialized rare disease ontologies like Orphanet\n(Weinreich et al., 2008; Mazzucato et al., 2023). For-\ntunately, recent advancements in phenotype extrac-\ntion with LLMs (Garcia et al., 2024) and rare dis-\nease mention extraction, such as RDMA (Wu et al.,\n2025), have achieved high precision results. Lever-\naging RDMA, we mine phenotypes mapped to the\nHuman Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and rare dis-\neases mapped to the Orphanet ontology.\nWe vali-\ndate the rare disease mentions (explicitly defined by\nOrphanet) with four medical students to ensure only\ntrue positive cases exist in our benchmark.\nOur findings demonstrate that:\n• LLMs severely underperform in rare disease dif-\nferential diagnosis despite higher reported per-\nformance in prior work (Chen et al., 2025)\n• Key challenges exist in the relationship between\npatient phenotype presentation and the ability\nto correctly predict rare diseases\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "We hope this work serves as an entry point for\nbetter discussions surrounding the use of LLMs for\ndifferential diagnosis as a key component of future\nhealthcare research.\n2. Methodology\nMining rare diseases and phenotypes. We use\nRDMA (Wu et al., 2025) to extract rare disease men-\ntions from clinical notes.\nThe approach follows a\nthree-step process: LLMs first extract potential rare\ndisease entities, then verify whether they represent\nactual rare diseases, and finally map them to their\nrespective ontologies. To balance reliability and di-\nversity in our entity capture, we run this pipeline\ntwice—once at low temperature (T = 0.01) for consis-\ntent results and once at high temperature (T = 0.7)\nfor broader coverage.\nNext, four medical students manually verify each\nextracted rare disease mention within its clinical con-\ntext, determining whether it truly represents a rare\ndisease according to Orphanet criteria (Weinreich\net al., 2008). Annotators make binary ”yes or no”\ndecisions on whether each mined entity constitutes a\ngenuine rare disease observation for the patient. We\nthen create a high-agreement subset for final evalua-\ntion, requiring consensus from at least three annota-\ntors.\nFor patients with verified rare disease mentions, we\nextract phenotypes using the same three-step RDMA\npipeline, mapping them directly to the Human Phe-\nnotype Ontology (Gargano et al., 2024). As a final\npreprocessing step, we address cases where entities\nmap to both Orphanet and the Human Phenotype\nOntology, making them both rare diseases and phe-\nnotypes.\nWe remove these overlapping phenotypes\n(less than 2.5% of cases) from each patient’s pheno-\ntype set to avoid redundancy.\nDifferential diagnosis setup. Effectively, given\na patient’s list of observed phenotypes, LLMs are\nasked to predict a list of the 10 most likely rare dis-\neases in order of likelihood. To benchmark their per-\nformance, we check if an observed rare disease falls\nwithin their top k predictions, hence the Hit@k met-\nric (k = 1, 5, 10).\n3. Results\nBaselines.\nWe explore 5 readily available open\nsource models. OpenBio-LLM 70B (Ankit Pal, 2024),\nQwen 3 32B (Yang et al., 2025), Llama 3.3 70B\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024), Mistral 3.1 24B (AI, 2025),\nand Mixtral 70B (Jiang et al., 2024).\nReal-world clinical setups are substantially\nmore complex.\nWe sampled 1,000 patients from\nMIMIC-IV (Johnson et al., 2023b) and mined their\nclinical notes for rare disease mentions.\nUsing\nRDMA, we identified 223 patients who contained rare\ndisease references.\nOur annotators then reviewed\nthese cases and confirmed rare diseases in 145 pa-\ntients with high inter-rater agreement. From the dis-\ncharge summaries of these 145 confirmed cases, we ex-\ntracted associated phenotypes. Our benchmark con-\ntains an average of approximately 128 phenotypes\nper patient—substantially more than existing pub-\nlic benchmarks including RAMEDIS (T¨opel et al.,\n2010), MME (Philippakis et al., 2015), HMS (Ron-\nicke et al., 2019), and Lirical (Robinson et al., 2020),\nas shown in Figure 2.\nIn contrast with our mined\nphenotypes, our dataset contains far fewer observed\nrare diseases, averaging approximately 1 per patient.\nFigure 2: Mined from clinical notes with thousands of\nwords, MIMIC-RD offers substantially greater num-\nbers of phenotypes per patient for each rare disease.\nAs a key implication, this dramatic increase in obser-\nvations makes differential diagnosis a more compli-\ncated task as LLMs have to consider upwards of 10x\nmore phenotypes in its differential diagnosis.\nOpen-source LLMs still highly underper-\nform\nin\ndifferential\ndiagnosis\nrare\ndisease\ntasks. Even when phenotypes and rare diseases are\nextracted from the same clinical note, state-of-the-\nart open-source LLMs fail to predict approximately\n60% of observed rare diseases given their relevant\nphenotypes.

Our rare disease pheno-\ntype characterization mapping from Orphanet (Wein-\nreich et al., 2008) reveals a wide range of rare diseases\nassociated with each phenotype, from 1 to over 1,026\ndiseases.
