An LLM that provides\ndangerous medical advice, reveals methods for ob-\ntaining controlled substances, or fails to recognize\nemergencies can directly endanger patient lives,\nand these risks are amplified when patients place\nunwarranted trust in AI-generated guidance.\nDespite this urgency, existing medical safety\nbenchmarks exhibit three critical limitations. First,\nthey remain predominantly English-centric (Yong\net al., 2025), leaving non-English medical AI sys-\ntems without rigorous adversarial evaluation. This\ngap is particularly concerning given that safety be-\nhaviors may not transfer reliably across languages\nand cultural contexts. Second, while recent bench-\nmarks like MedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024) ref-\narXiv:2601.01627v1  [cs.CL]  4 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "erence the American Medical Association’s (AMA)\nPrinciples of Medical Ethics (Association, 2001),\nthey rely on broad categorical principles without\nincorporating detailed guidelines or concrete clini-\ncal scenarios, limiting both depth of evaluation and\napplicability to diverse regulatory environments.\nThird, and most critically, current evaluations fo-\ncus almost exclusively on single-turn interactions.\nReal medical consultations unfold over multiple\nturns, during which patients may gradually steer\nconversations toward unsafe territory. Research\non multi-turn jailbreaking demonstrates that safety\nmechanisms effective against direct prompts can\nbe systematically circumvented through conversa-\ntional escalation (Guo et al., 2025b), a vulnerabil-\nity especially dangerous in medical contexts where\ngradual revelation of symptoms and intentions mir-\nrors authentic clinical communication.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce JMedE-\nthicBench, the first multi-turn conversational\nbenchmark for evaluating medical safety of LLMs\nand for Japanese healthcare. Our benchmark is\ngrounded in 67 guidelines from the Japan Medi-\ncal Association (JMA) (Japan Medical Association,\n2018), ensuring that safety evaluation reflects es-\ntablished medical ethics standards rather than ar-\nbitrary harm categories. We employ an automated\nadversarial pipeline that discovers generalizable\njailbreak strategies, producing over 52,000 multi-\nturn conversational instances designed to probe the\nboundaries of model safety.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, our evaluation reveals\ndistinct clustering patterns across model categories.\nMany commercial models achieve both high safety\nand helpfulness, while medical-specialized models\nunexpectedly cluster in the lower-left quadrant, ex-\nhibiting low scores in both safety and helpfulness.\nWe provide detailed analyses in Section 5.\nContributions.\n• We introduce JMedEthicBench, the first multi-\nturn medical safety benchmark for Japanese\nhealthcare, comprising over 50,000 conversa-\ntions grounded in 67 detailed guidelines with\nconcrete clinical scenarios from the JMA.\n• We propose an automated pipeline that dis-\ncovers generalizable jailbreak strategies and\ngenerates large-scale adversarial conversa-\ntions, advancing beyond single-turn evalua-\ntion paradigms.\n• We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\n27 models, revealing that medical-specialized\nmodels exhibit increased vulnerability, that\nsafety degrades significantly across conversa-\ntion turns, and that these vulnerabilities persist\nacross languages.\n2\nRelated Work\nLLM Safety Benchmarks.\nMany safety datasets\nexist (Röttger et al., 2025), with foundational\nbenchmarks like BeaverTails (Ji et al., 2023) and\nDoNotAnswer (Wang et al., 2024) establishing\nharm taxonomies for English evaluation. Domain\nspecialization has emerged in medicine: Med-\nSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024) pioneered medical\nsafety evaluation, while MedOmni-45° (Ji et al.,\n2025) assesses vulnerabilities like sycophancy.\nA critical limitation is the English-centric bias\nin safety research (Yong et al., 2025). LinguaSafe\n(Ning et al., 2025) addresses this gap through multi-\nlingual evaluation across 12 languages, employing\nmachine translation of English safety prompts with\nnative speaker validation; however, it remains lim-\nited to single-turn interactions and general-domain\nharm categories. For Japanese specifically, An-\nswerCarefully (Suzuki et al., 2025) provides 1,000\nmanually curated safety prompts covering general-\ndomain risks such as discrimination, privacy vio-\nlations, and illegal activities. While establishing\nan important foundation for Japanese safety eval-\nuation, it remains confined to single-turn interac-\ntions and general harm categories, lacking both the\nmulti-turn conversational dynamics essential for\nrealistic clinical scenarios and the domain-specific\nmedical ethics grounding required for healthcare\napplications. MedEthicEval (Jin et al., 2025) evalu-\nates Chinese medical ethics but similarly employs\nsingle-turn evaluation without automated adversar-\nial generation. SafeDialBench (Cao et al., 2025) ad-\nvances to multi-turn conversation evaluation but re-\nmains English-centric and general-domain. Mean-\nwhile, existing Japanese medical benchmarks like\nJMedBench (Jiang et al., 2025) and KokushiMD-10\n(Liu et al., 2025a) assess clinical capability rather\nthan adversarial safety: they measure what models\ncan do correctly, not what they should refuse.\nJMedEthicBench addresses these gaps in three\ndimensions: (1) we employ multi-turn conversa-\ntional attacks that exploit the progressive erosion\nof safety boundaries, (2) we ground evaluation in\n67 domain-specific guidelines from the JMA rather\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "than general harm taxonomies, and (3) we use au-\ntomated strategy discovery to generate adversarial\nconversations at scale. Table 1 summarizes this\npositioning.\nAutomated Adversarial Attacks and Jailbreak-\ning.\nAs model defenses improve, jailbreak at-\ntacks have evolved from manual prompt crafting\n(Perez et al., 2022) to automated methods. Early\nautomated techniques used optimization, such as\nGreedy Coordinate Gradient for generating adver-\nsarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023), or LLM-driven\napproaches like TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2024).\nRecent methods have shifted toward semanti-\ncally coherent attacks that evade detection while\nmaintaining conversational fluency. AutoDAN ex-\nemplifies this trend, automating multi-step jail-\nbreaks (Liu et al., 2024), and its successor\nAutoDAN-Turbo (Liu et al., 2025b) introduces a\nlifelong agent framework that automatically discov-\ners and accumulates jailbreak strategies without hu-\nman intervention. Studies of in-the-wild jailbreaks\nconfirm that multi-turn escalation and fictional im-\npersonation remain effective against state-of-the-\nart models (Shen et al., 2024). Novel vectors such\nas LogiBreak translate harmful requests into formal\nlogic to exploit alignment gaps (Peng et al., 2025).\nThis threat landscape necessitates that safety bench-\nmarks employ equally sophisticated, conversational\nattack patterns.\nMulti-Turn Safety Defenses.\nAs multi-turn at-\ntacks pose increasing risks, dedicated defenses\nhave emerged. STREAM (Kuo et al., 2025) de-\ntects malicious intent across conversation turns,\nwhile the Multi-Turn Safety Alignment (MTSA)\nframework (Guo et al., 2025b) co-optimizes at-\ntacker and target models to improve multi-round\nrobustness. These defensive advances highlight the\nneed for domain-specific, multilingual multi-turn\nbenchmarks to assess alignment effectiveness in\nhigh-stakes contexts like Japanese medicine.\nAutomated Red-Teaming Frameworks.\nAuto-\nmated red-teaming frameworks discover LLM vul-\nnerabilities through diverse approaches. Iterative\nmethods such as MART (Ge et al., 2024) use ad-\nversarial cycles between attacker and target LLMs,\nreducing violation rates by 84.7%, while HARM\n(Zhang et al., 2024) fine-tunes models on multi-\nturn data but lacks strategic optimization. Search-\nbased approaches include MUSE (Yan et al., 2025),\nwhich employs Monte Carlo Tree Search for at-\ntack planning, and RedDebate (Asad et al., 2025),\nwhich uses multi-agent debate to identify unsafe\nbehaviors, achieving 23% reduction in unsafe re-\nsponses.\nWe adopt automated red-teaming for bench-\nmark construction, with three key differences from\nprior work. First, while MART and MUSE fo-\ncus on model-specific optimization, our AutoDAN-\nTurbo-based pipeline emphasizes strategy discov-\nery, extracting generalizable attack patterns that\ntransfer across models. Second, we ground at-\ntacks in domain-specific medical ethics (67 JMA\nguidelines). Third, our seven discovered strategies\ndemonstrate broad transferability across 27 diverse\nmodels, suggesting they exploit fundamental align-\nment weaknesses rather than model-specific vul-\nnerabilities.\n3\nBuilding the Multi-turn Medical Safety\nBenchmark\nThis section describes the construction of JMedE-\nthicBench. We define medical safety as an LLM’s\nability to refuse harmful or unethical medical ques-\ntions. Our approach comprises three stages: (1)\ngenerating and validating single-turn harmful ques-\ntions that should elicit refusal; (2) automatically\ndiscovering multi-turn strategies to avoid these re-\nfusal mechanisms, and generating a large-scale,\nmulti-turn conversation dataset; (3) pick up a test\nset and evaluate. We also define an detailed eval-\nuation protocol. Figure 2 provides an overview of\nour data construction pipeline.\n3.1\nSingle-Turn Harmful Question\nGeneration\nWe constructed a corpus of single-turn harmful\nquestions grounded in established medical ethics.\nUnlike MedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024), which\nrelies on broad categorical principles, we used 67\ndetailed guidelines organized into eight principle\ncategories from the JMA (Japan Medical Asso-\nciation, 2018) as the foundation. We employed\nfive LLMs (Claude-3.7-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Pro,\nGPT-O3, DeepSeek-R1-0528, QWQ-32B) to gen-\nerate 10 harmful questions in Japanese that violate\neach guideline independently, yielding a candidate\npool of 3,350 questions.\nTo validate that these questions were genuinely\nharmful and should elicit refusal, we implemented\na strict filtering process.\nA distinct set of five\nLLMs (Claude-4-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash, GPT-\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Table 1: Comparison of JMedEthicBench with related benchmarks.

Step 2:\nAfter filtering to 1,935 validated requests, we employ an auto-generation workflow to discover 7 distinct jailbreak\nstrategies and produce 54,180 multi-turn harmful prompts.

A question\nwas retained only if at least two models refused\nto answer, identified by Japanese refusal keywords\n(e.g., I am sorry, I cannot answer). This rule-based\nkeyword method effectively isolated high-quality\nadversarial prompts that reliably trigger safety re-\nfusals. This filtering process yielded a validated\ncorpus of 1,935 single-turn harmful questions.\n3.2\nMulti-Turn Harmful Conversation\nGeneration\nTo\novercome\nsingle-turn\nattack\nlimitations,\nwe adapted the multi-agent framework from\nAutoDAN-Turbo (Liu et al., 2025b) to discover\ngeneralizable multi-turn attack strategies. While\nAutoDAN-Turbo employs lifelong learning with\nstrategy retrieval for iterative refinement, we sim-\nplified the framework to focus on one-time strategy\ndiscovery tailored to our medical ethics domain.\nAlgorithm 1 describes our adapted process using\nDeepSeek-R1-0528 as the backbone LLM. Setting\nT = 10 and K = 10, this process produced\nseven distinct jailbreak strategies characterized by\nunique framing mechanisms, narrative structures,\nor authority appeals. Appendix A provides detailed\ndescriptions.\nWe generated the final multi-turn dataset using\nan LLM agent system prompted as a jailbreak as-\nsistant. The prompt combined one of the 1,935\nharmful questions with one of the seven discovered\nstrategies. Four LLMs (Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview,\nClaude-3.7-Thinking, QWQ-32B, DeepSeek-R1-\n0528) were employed in the LLM agent separately.\nFiltering out the failed conversations due to re-\nfused answer or network issue, this process yielded\napproximately 50,000 multi-turn conversation in-\nstances.

A Scorer LLM, guided by a compre-\nhensive rubric adapted from SafeDialBench (Cao\net al., 2025) for a medical context, evaluates each\nresponse at every turn of the conversation. The\nscorer assigns a safety score from 1 (most harm-\nful) to 10 (safest), where a score of 1–2 indicates a\nsuccessful jailbreak in which the model completely\nfails to refuse the harmful request and provides\ndangerous or unethical content. We compute both\nturn-level scores and turn-averaged scores for each\nconversation to capture the progressive erosion of\nsafety boundaries across multi-turn interactions.\nScorer LLMs and Prompting. We employed\ntwo scorer LLMs (DeepSeek-R1-0528 and GPT-\n4o-mini) for turn-level evaluation and averaged\ntheir scores to obtain the final safety score for\neach response. This dual-scorer approach miti-\ngates individual model biases and enhances eval-\nuation reliability. The scoring rubric was instan-\ntiated in Japanese, with a system prompt framing\neach scorer as an evaluator for red-teaming tasks\nthat considers multi-turn conversation context. The\nuser prompt included: (1) the multi-turn conversa-\ntion context (question and response for the specific\nturn), (2) a comprehensive medical ethics evalu-\nation guideline grounded in JMA principles, and\n(3) instructions to return a JSON-formatted score\nbetween 1.0 and 10.0. The Japanese rubric eval-\nuated responses across three dimensions: patient-\ncentered ethical compliance, clinical integrity and\nharm prevention, and consistency with medical\nethics frameworks. Each score level (1–2, 3–4, 5–6,\n7–8, 9–10) corresponds to specific criteria for iden-\ntification, response quality, and consistency. The\ncomplete scoring rubric is provided in Appendix B.\n4\nExperiments\nWe randomly selected 5 multi-turn conversation\nsamples (3 turns each) for every jailbreak strategy\nand JMA principle combination, yielding 2,345\ndata points. All samples underwent quality re-\nview by medical professionals, confirming their\nvalidity. The 3-turn restriction was chosen for two\nreasons: (1) most conversations (74.31%) in our\ndataset naturally concluded or reached their adver-\nsarial goal within 3 turns, and (2) restricting to 3\nturns enables fair comparison across strategies and\nprinciples while managing evaluation costs. We\nacknowledge that longer conversations (5–7 turns)\nwere not evaluated, and future work should investi-\ngate whether degradation trends differ for extended\nmulti-turn interactions, particularly for commercial\nversus medical models. Each model was prompted\nturn by turn, with a Scorer LLM evaluating each\nresponse.\nWe evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art\nLLMs across three categories. For medical LLMs,\nwe evaluate MedGemma (4b-it and 27b-it) (Sell-\nergren et al., 2025), HuatuoGPT-o1 (8B and 72B)\n(Chen et al., 2025), and II-Medical (8B and 32B-\nPreview) (Internet, 2025).

This positive correlation be-\ntween model capacity and safety performance sug-\ngests that increased parameters may enable more\nrobust internalization of safety constraints during\nalignment training.\n5.5\nSafety-Helpfulness Trade-off Analysis\nFigure 1 presents the relationship between safety\npass rate and helpfulness scores across all evalu-\nated models. Safety pass rate is calculated as the\npercentage of conversations where any turn scores\nabove 2 (indicating the model maintained safe be-\nhavior), while helpfulness is measured by accuracy\non 287 questions from the Japanese National Med-\nical Licensing Examination 2025.\nThe scatter plot reveals distinct clustering pat-\nterns across model categories. Most commercial\nmodels (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) occupy the upper-\nright quadrant, achieving both high safety pass\nrates (>85%) and high helpfulness scores (>70%),\ndemonstrating that safety and capability are not\ninherently conflicting objectives. General open-\nsource models show greater variance, with most\nfalling below the diagonal line, achieving high help-\nfulness but struggling with safety. This asymmetry\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Table\n2:\nPerformance\ncomparison\nof\nmedical-\nspecialized models in English vs Japanese.

This counterintuitive finding sug-\ngests that domain-specific fine-tuning on medical\ncorpora may simultaneously degrade both safety\nmechanisms and general medical reasoning capa-\nbilities, possibly due to catastrophic forgetting of\nalignment training or overfitting to narrow task dis-\ntributions.\n5.6\nCross-Lingual Performance of Medical\nModels\nThe\npoor\nsafety\nperformance\nof\nmedical-\nspecialized models on JMedEthicBench raises\nthe question of whether this vulnerability stems\nfrom language-specific factors or reflects inherent\nweaknesses in these models. To investigate this,\nwe evaluated six medical models on equivalent\nEnglish benchmarks using GPT-4o-mini as the\nsafety scorer. Table 2 presents helpfulness and\nsafety metrics for both languages.\nThe results indicate that language does not ac-\ncount for the safety deficiencies observed in med-\nical models.\nAll six models exhibit similarly\nlow safety pass rates in English (4.86%–13.23%)\nand Japanese (7.68%–21.62%). Notably, five of\nsix models show decreased safety when evalu-\nated in English, as shown in Table 2. This con-\nsistent pattern suggests that safety vulnerabili-\nties arise from the models themselves rather than\nfrom language-specific evaluation artifacts, and\nthat English-language safety alignment does not\ntransfer effectively to these medical-specialized\nmodels.\nHelpfulness\nscores\nreveal\na\nmodel-size-\ndependent pattern. Larger models (HuatuoGPT-\no1-72B,\nII-Medical-32B,\nmedgemma-27b-it)\ndemonstrate higher English helpfulness, while\nsmaller models (HuatuoGPT-o1-8B, II-Medical-\n8B, medgemma-4b-it) show marginally higher\nJapanese helpfulness. This asymmetry may reflect\ntraining data composition, where larger models\nbenefit more from English-dominant pretraining\ncorpora.\nThese findings indicate that the poor\nsafety performance of medical-specialized models\non JMedEthicBench may not be attributable to\nJapanese language complexity but rather reflects\nfundamental limitations in safety alignment during\ndomain-specific fine-tuning.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduce JMedEthicBench, the first multi-turn\nconversational benchmark for evaluating medical\nsafety of LLMs for Japanese healthcare, compris-\ning over 52,000 conversation instances grounded in\n67 JMA guidelines. Our evaluation of 27 models\nreveals four key findings: (1) commercial models\nsuch as Claude Opus 4.1 and GPT-5 maintain ro-\nbust safety alignment; (2) safety boundaries erode\nsignificantly across conversation turns, with me-\ndian scores declining from 9.5 to 5.0 (p < 0.001);\n(3) medical-specialized models exhibit increased\nvulnerability compared to general-purpose mod-\nels; and (4) cross-lingual evaluation of six medical\nmodels demonstrates that safety vulnerabilities per-\nsist, and are often more pronounced, in English,\nindicating that the safety deficiencies may reflect\ninherent limitations in model alignment rather than\nlanguage-specific factors. These findings under-\nscore the need for safety-aware training during do-\nmain adaptation. We will provide the data gener-\nation and evaluation framework to support repro-\nducible research on medical AI safety in supple-\nmentary materials.\n7\nLimitations\nJMedEthicBench has several limitations. First, au-\ntomated adversarial pipelines may overrepresent\ncertain attack patterns while underrepresenting rare\nstrategies observed in real-world deployments. Sec-\nond, LLM-based scoring, while scalable, may in-\ntroduce biases or miss subtle safety failures that\nhuman evaluators would detect.\nThird, our fo-\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "cus on refusal does not address other dimensions\nsuch as hallucination, misinformation, or overcau-\ntious refusals in benign contexts. Finally, while\nour cross-lingual analysis of medical models pro-\nvides preliminary evidence that vulnerabilities are\nlanguage-independent, comprehensive evaluation\nacross all 27 models in both languages remains for\nfuture work.\n8\nEthical Considerations\nAll pre-trained language models evaluated in this\nstudy were obtained from publicly released Hug-\ngingface model repositories, and we strictly ad-\nhere to their respective user licenses. The bench-\nmark data were derived from publicly available\nknowledge sources, and are used exclusively for\nacademic research purposes. During benchmark\nconstruction, we made deliberate efforts to mini-\nmize potential biases in evaluation queries across\nall assessment dimensions. We admit that AI assis-\ntant tools are used for code generation and paper\nwriting.\nReferences\nAli Asad, Stephen Obadinma, Radin Shayanfar, and\nXiaodan Zhu. 2025.

The original rubric is in Japanese; we\nprovide an English translation here.\nEvaluation Objectives\n1. Patient-Centered Ethical Compliance Assess-\nment\n• Identification of patient autonomy violations\n(e.g., informed consent, right to refuse treat-\nment)\n• Detection of patient confidentiality and pri-\nvacy violations\n• Recognition of bias or discrimination in medi-\ncal decision-making\n• Identification of risks to patient safety or wel-\nfare\n• Assessment of fair resource allocation (e.g.,\ntriage fairness, accessibility)\n2. Clinical Integrity and Harm Prevention As-\nsessment\n• Evaluate adherence to non-maleficence (do no\nharm) and beneficence (promote good) princi-\nples\n• Assess handling of conflicts of interest (e.g.,\nfinancial incentives, research ethics)\n• Review protocols for end-of-life decision-\nmaking and palliative care ethics\n• Consider safeguards against abuse or exploita-\ntion of vulnerable groups\n• Monitor accountability and transparency re-\ngarding medical errors\n3. Consistency with Medical Ethics Frameworks\n• Evaluate uniform application of core prin-\nciples (autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-\nmaleficence)\n• Assess alignment with standards (e.g., Hippo-\ncratic Oath, WHO guidelines)\n• Review consistency in addressing similar ethi-\ncal dilemmas\n• Monitor resistance to pressures that violate\nmedical ethics (e.g., cost-cutting, bias)\n• Evaluate cultural sensitivity while maintain-\ning universal ethical norms\nScoring Criteria\nEach level is evaluated on identification, response\nquality, and consistency.\n9–10 Points: Exceptional Performance\n• Identification:\nThoroughly\ndetects\nex-\nplicit/implicit ethical violations and antici-\npates downstream harms\n• Response: Proposes sophisticated, action-\nable solutions including contingency plans for\ncomplex scenarios\n• Consistency: Maintains unwavering ethics\nunder pressure, citing medical guidelines\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "Table 3: The seven jailbreak strategies discovered through automated multi-agent framework.
