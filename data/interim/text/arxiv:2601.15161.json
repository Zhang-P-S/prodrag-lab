Recent advances in LLMs further expand\ntheir potential in medical applications, ranging\nfrom differential diagnosis (McDuff et al., 2023)\nand stepwise clinical reasoning (Brodeur et al.,\n2024; Savage et al., 2024) to empathetic patient\ncommunication (Maida et al., 2024). However,\nreliable and scalable evaluation of these systems\nhas become a central challenge.\nConventional\napproaches relying on surface-level metrics or\nmultiple-choice benchmarks fail to capture clinical\nreasoning (Croxford et al., 2025). Expert human\nassessment better reflects clinical judgment, yet its\nhigh cost and limited inter-rater consistency hinder\nscalability (Arora et al., 2025).\nTo address scalability, LLM-as-a-Judge has been\nproposed as an automated evaluation paradigm and\nhas shown promising results in general domains\n(Zheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2024; Rahmani\net al., 2025a). However, prior studies show that\nwhen evaluation criteria are coarse, LLM-based\njudging can suffer from bias (Shi et al., 2024;\nRahmani et al., 2024), limited reproducibility (Ya-\nmauchi et al., 2025), and insensitivity to subtle\nbut important differences (Kim et al., 2025). This\nissue is particularly consequential in medical set-\ntings: analyses show that medical errors are of-\nten embedded in clinically plausible language and\nseemingly coherent reasoning (Asgari et al., 2025).\nThe detectability of such errors depends critically\non the evaluator’s level of domain expertise and\nthe quality of the prompt provided to the model,\nmaking them particularly difficult to identify for\nnon-experts and automated evaluation systems (As-\ngari et al., 2025; Rahmani et al., 2025a; Liu et al.,\n2024). When undetected, errors in clinical rea-\nsoning or treatment recommendations can delay\nappropriate care or lead to inappropriate interven-\ntions, substantially increasing the stakes of evalu-\nation failures in medical applications (Mehta and\nDevarakonda, 2018; Miles-Jay et al., 2023; Xia\net al., 2024). These findings highlight that medical\nLLM evaluation cannot rely solely on implicit or\nimpression-based judgments.\nA natural mitigation is to adopt fine-grained eval-\nuation criteria that ground judgments in explicit,\n1\narXiv:2601.15161v1  [cs.CL]  21 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Authoritative Medical \nKnowledge Sources\n(e.g., CDC PubMed, WHO)\nUser \nMedical \nQuery\nRouting Agent\n(Smart/Fast \nStrategy)\nEvidence \nSynthesize Agent\n(De-duplication & \nConflict Check)\nInteraction Intent \nAgent\n(Instruction & Emotion \nCue Extraction)\nMedical Fact \nAgent\n(Atomic Fact \nDecomposition)\nReference Board\n(Atomic Facts)\nRubric Synthesis \nAgent\n(Initial Criteria \nGeneration)\nAuditing Agent\n(Gap Analysis & \nQuality Control)\nStructured \nMedical \nRubric\nStage 1\nRetrieval & Evidence Preparation\nStage 2\nDual-Track Constraint Construction\nStage 3\nAudit & Refinement\nRefinement Loop\n(Triggered by Gap Analysis)\nFigure 1: Retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework for medical rubric generation.

Instead of relying\non abstract dimensions, rubric-based evaluation\nspecifies what a high-quality response should in-\nclude or avoid in concrete clinical terms. Recent\nwork has shown that structured or decomposed eval-\nuation schemes can improve interpretability and\nconsistency of automated judgments (Liu et al.,\n2023; Arora et al., 2025). However, medical dia-\nlogue is highly context-dependent: generic rubrics\nare often too coarse to capture instance-specific\nclinical priorities, while instance-level rubrics,\nthough more precise, introduce substantial anno-\ntation cost and stability challenges, limiting their\npracticality for large-scale evaluation (Kim et al.,\n2025).\nTo address this gap, we propose a retrieval-\naugmented multi-agent framework for automat-\nically\ngenerating\ninstance-specific\nevaluation\nrubrics in medical dialogue through three coordi-\nnated stages. First, Retrieval and Evidence Prepa-\nration stage employs a routing strategy to gather\nand synthesize authoritative medical knowledge\ninto a unified evidence block. Second, a Dual-\nTrack Construction mechanism effectively de-\ncomposes this evidence into atomic medical facts\n(creating a ’Reference Board’) while in parallel ex-\ntracting interaction intents from the user query. Fi-\nnally, the Audit and Refinement stage synthesizes\nthese inputs into structured criteria and enforces\nclinical coverage via an Auditing Agent, which\nperforms a gap analysis against the atomic facts\nto trigger iterative refinement. This framework\neffectively combines the scalability of automated\nsystems with the clinical rigor of expert verifica-\ntion.\nOur contributions: (1) a retrieval-augmented\nmulti-agent framework for instance-specific medi-\ncal rubric generation, achieving 60.12% Clinical\nIntent Alignment (CIA) and significantly outper-\nforming GPT-4o baseline; (2) enhanced discrimi-\nnative sensitivity, with a mean score delta of 8.658\nand an AUROC of 0.977, enabling precise detec-\ntion of subtle, near-miss clinical errors; and (3)\nactionable rubric-based feedback for refinement,\nimproving downstream response quality by 9.2%\nthrough controlled, rubric-guided edits. Together,\nthese findings establish that automated, knowledge-\ngrounded rubrics provide a scalable and transparent\nfoundation for both evaluating and improving med-\nical language model outputs.\n2\nRelated Work\nNLU Evaluation.\nEarly work on medical NLP\nevaluation focused on NLU-style tasks such as\nMedQA (Jin et al., 2020), MedMCQA (Pal et al.,\n2021), PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), and MMLU\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021), which primarily test fac-\ntual medical knowledge through multiple-choice\nquestions. These benchmarks played an important\nrole in assessing domain knowledge, but fail to\ncapture clinical reasoning, contextual understand-\ning, or the quality of patient-facing communication\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "(Croxford et al., 2025).\nNLG Evaluation.\nAs medical generation tasks\nemerged, datasets such as MedDialog (Zeng et al.,\n2020) and COVID-QA (Möller et al., 2020) were\nevaluated using generic NLG metrics such as\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin,\n2004), and METEOR (Snover et al., 2006). Later\nembedding-based metrics such as BERTScore\n(Zhang et al., 2019) and Sentence-BERT (Reimers\nand Gurevych, 2019) attempted to improve se-\nmantic alignment. More recent benchmarks such\nas HealthSearchQA (Singhal et al., 2023), Multi-\nMedQA (Singhal et al., 2023) and Med-Eval (He\net al., 2023) introduced reference-free and human-\ngraded evaluation to better assess open-ended gen-\neration. These benchmarks more closely reflect\nreal-world clinical needs by enabling open-ended\nevaluation, but they are labour-intensive and costly.\nLLM-as-a-Judge.\nLLM-as-a-judge has emerged\nas a scalable alternative to human evaluation for\nopen-ended generation tasks (Zheng et al., 2023;\nDubois et al., 2024; Rahmani et al., 2025a). In\ngeneral domains, strong language models correlate\nreasonably well with human preferences in pair-\nwise or ranking-based evaluation, as demonstrated\nby frameworks such as MT-Bench and Chatbot\nArena (Zheng et al., 2023), which have become de\nfacto standards for general-purpose LLM compar-\nison. Relatedly, AlpacaEval (Dubois et al., 2024)\nprovides a standardised preference-based pipeline\nthat supports rapid benchmarking.\nTo enhance the reliability and interpretabil-\nity of automated evaluation, recent research has\nadopted more rigorous architectures. One signif-\nicant direction involves structured judging proto-\ncols that decompose evaluation into explicit crite-\nria(e.g., G-Eval Liu et al., 2023, Prometheus 2 Kim\net al., 2024).\nRetrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) has been widely adopted\nto reduce hallucination and improve factual ground-\ning. For instance, systems like MiniCheck (Tang\net al., 2024) utilize retrieval to verify the fac-\ntual precision of model outputs against external\ndocuments. To further mitigate individual model\nbias, recent approaches have incorporated multi-\nagent collaboration strategies, employing mecha-\nnisms such as debate (Liang and et al., 2023), self-\nconsistency(Wang et al., 2023) and ensemble aggre-\ngation (Rahmani et al., 2025b) to yield more robust\njudgments. However, most paradigms primarily uti-\nlize agents and retrieval to assess responses based\non fixed or latent standards. Even when structurally\nexplicit, these approaches remain content-generic,\nrelying on prompts or model parameters, and re-\nmain sensitive to instruction phrasing and framing,\nparticularly in high-stakes settings (Arroyo et al.,\n2024; Thomas et al., 2024). This motivates ap-\nproaches that make evaluation criteria explicit and\nstructured, rather than relying solely on latent judge\npreferences.\nRubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge.\nTo address\nopacity, recent work has introduced fine-grained\nrubrics to guide LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.\nLLMEval-Med (Zhang et al., 2025) employs\nchecklist-style criteria specific to each dialogue,\nwhile HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025) pro-\nvides conversation-specific rubrics covering axes\nsuch as accuracy, completeness, communication,\nand safety.\nWhile these fain-grained rubric-\nbased frameworks improve transparency and multi-\ndimensionality, they rely on costly, manual expert\nconstruction that fails to scale with evolving clin-\nical knowledge. Although SedarEval (Fan et al.,\n2024) explores automated rubric generation, it fo-\ncuses on general domains and lacks the rigorous\nclinical grounding required for medical dialogue.\nBecause it lacks the retrieval mechanisms necessary\nto access specific medical protocols, it is unsuitable\nfor verifying clinical correctness, and thus we do\nnot use it as a baseline.\nSummary and Positioning.\nExisting research on\nautomated medical LLM evaluation either relies\non expert-authored rubrics, which ensure accuracy\nbut are costly and rigid, or on generic rubric-based\njudges, which scale easily but lack transparency\nand grounding. Our work integrates these direc-\ntions by introducing a knowledge-grounded, multi-\nagent RAG framework for generating instance-\nspecific rubrics in medical dialogue evaluation,\ncombining interpretability, factual grounding, and\nscalability within a unified paradigm.\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nProblem Formulation\nWe formalize medical rubric generation as a multi-\nstage mapping across information spaces, opti-\nmized via a multi-agent framework (Fig. 1). Given\na user query Q and an authoritative medical knowl-\nedge base K, we aim to produce a structured evalu-\nation rubric R as follows:\nR = {(cj, aj, wj)}n\nj=1,\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "where cj is the criterion, aj the evaluation axis,\nand wj ∈Z ∩[−10, 10] the clinical weight. A\ndetailed reference of all mathematical notations,\ndata structures, and agent operators is provided in\nTable 5 and Table 6.\nThe pipeline executes in three sequential stages:\nStage 1: Retrieval & Evidence Preparation\n(R, S). This stage maps the user query Q to the\nevidence space E. First, the Routing Agent (R)\ntransforms the user query Q into a set of optimized\nsearch queries:\nQsearch = R(Q)\n(1)\nThese queries are used to retrieve raw candidates\nfrom K. Then, the Evidence Synthesis Agent (S)\naggregates the retrieved results, which are priori-\ntized by a reranker agent to ensure clinical author-\nity, into a coherent evidence block:\nE = S(Qsearch, K)\n(2)\nStage 2: Dual-Track Constraint Construction\n(D, T ). To ensure the rubric captures both factual\naccuracy and conversational quality, we decom-\npose the evidence and the query into objective D\nand subjective T dimensions. The Medical Fact\nAgent (D) distills and filters evidence E into a set\nof atomic facts F (the Reference Board). In par-\nallel, the Interaction Intent Agent (T ) extracts\ncommunication constraints I from user query con-\ntext:\nF = D(E),\nI = T (Q, E).\n(3)\nStage 3: Audit & Refinement (Φ, A). The Rubric\nSynthesis Agent (Φ) maps facts F and intent I to\nan initial draft rubric:\nRinit = Φ(F, I, Q)\n(4)\nTo ensure validity, the Auditing Agent (A) per-\nforms a structured audit by cross-referencing Rinit\nagainst the ground truth facts F and I.\nIt ex-\necutes a process that first identifies and supple-\nments missing details (Gap Analysis), then filters\nout unsupported hallucinations or irrelevant con-\nstraints (Quality Control), and finally merges to\nfinal rubrics (R).\nR = A(Rinit, F, I)\n(5)\n3.2\nStage 1: Retrieval & Evidence\nPreparation\nThis stage implements the synthesis operator S,\naiming to construct a hierarchical retrieval pipeline\nthat balances reasoning depth and efficiency.\nRouting Agent (Smart–Fast Strategy).\nTo opti-\nmize the balance between deep reasoning and com-\nputational efficiency within the retrieval pipeline,\nwe adopt a Smart–Fast configuration. Motivated\nby MasRouter (Yue et al., 2025) and DiSRouter\n(Zheng et al., 2025), which show that delegating\ntasks across models with different capacities can\nbalance efficiency and performance, we route clin-\nically complex queries to a high-capacity model\n(smart) for intent identification and targeted query\ngeneration, while retrieved candidates are reranked\nby a lightweight model (fast) using authority-aware\ncriteria. Retrieval is strictly constrained to author-\nitative medical domains K (see Table 4 in Ap-\npendix), ensuring that non-professional or low-\ncredibility content is filtered out at the source.\nEvidence Synthesis Agent.\nThe Evidence Syn-\nthesis Agent consolidates multi-source retrieved\ncontent into a unified evidence block E. Through\ncross-checking and de-duplication, this stage re-\nsolves conflicts across sources and explicitly ex-\ntracts safety-critical signals, such as clinical con-\ntraindications and red-flag warnings. This process\nreduces hallucination risks for downstream compo-\nnents by establishing a reliable clinical grounding.\n3.3\nStage 2: Dual-Track Constraint\nConstruction\nInspired by prior medical multi-agent systems that\nemphasize functional role decomposition and co-\nordinated collaboration (Yang et al., 2024; Zhang\net al., 2024; Li et al., 2024a), we design a Dynamic\nAtomic Dual-Track scheme. This design indepen-\ndently constructs two complementary constraint\nviews to avoid interference when handling complex\nclinical evidence with a single monolithic prompt.\nMedical Fact Agent (Atomic Fact Decomposi-\ntion).\nThe Medical Fact Agent decomposes the\nsynthesized evidence E into a dynamic set of\natomic medical facts F (the Reference Board), in-\ncluding declarative assertions, contraindications,\nand safety-critical red flags. This claim-level de-\ncomposition is motivated by prior work on factual\nverification (Welleck et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b),\nand provides a structured source of truth for subse-\nquent auditing.\nInteraction Intent Agent.\nIn parallel, the Inter-\naction Intent Agent applies the operator T to ex-\ntract explicit instructions and implicit communica-\ntion cues from the user query. The system further\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "identifies medically necessary but missing contex-\ntual variables, ensuring that the resulting rubric\nincorporates context awareness. This design fol-\nlows prior work showing that evaluation should\nbe conditioned on user-defined criteria rather than\ninferred user profiles (Kim et al., 2024).\n3.4\nStage 3: Audit & Refinement\nThe final stage compiles constraints from both\ntracks into a finalized structured medical rubric,\nemphasizing coverage enforcement through closed-\nloop auditing.\nRubric Synthesis Agent.\nThe Rubric Synthesis\nAgent applies the operator Φ to generate an initial\nrubric Rinit, mapping medical facts to the accu-\nracy and completeness dimensions, and interaction\nconstraints to the communication quality dimen-\nsion.

This process is inspired by\nthe Reflexion paradigm (Shinn et al., 2023), but is\nspecialized to enforce medical safety and factual\ncoverage rather than purely linguistic quality.\nThe final output is a structured, clinically au-\nditable rubric Rfinal that balances factual rigor with\ncommunication quality. A concrete illustration of a\ngenerated rubric is shown in Table 7 in Appendix.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nDatasets\nWe evaluate our framework primarily on Health-\nBench (Arora et al., 2025), a public benchmark of\nmedical dialogues paired with physician-authored,\ninstance-specific rubrics. Each dialogue consists\nof a patient query and an ideal medical response\nreviewed by physicians, along with a couple of fine-\ngrained criteria that assess accuracy, completeness,\ncommunication quality, instruction following and\ncontext awareness. An example from HealthBench\nis shown in Figure 4.\nTo ensure a consistent and rigorous evaluation\nsetting, we curated a subset of 254 diverse medical\nqueries by filtering the HealthBench dataset based\non specific criteria: We selected English dialogues\nand each sample is paired with 8-10 physician-\nauthored gold criteria (cj) to control for evaluation\ncomplexity. To ensure multi-dimensional assess-\nment, we specifically select instances that encom-\npass at least three distinct evaluation axes (aj). This\nresulted in a test set of ~2.5k rubric items. These\nphysician-authored rubrics serve as the gold stan-\ndard G for calculating the Clinical Intent Align-\nment (CIA) metric defined in Section 4.4.\n4.2\nImplementation Detail\nAll agent prompts are provided in the Appendix B.\n4.2.1\nGeneration\nModel\nConfiguration.\nWe\nuse\nAPI-based\ninference\nwith\na\ntiered\nmodel\nconfigura-\ntion.\nLlama-3.3-70B-Instruct\nperforms\nintent\nrouting,\nevidence\nsynthesis,\natomic\nfact extraction/filtering,\nand rubric auditing.\nLlama-3.1-8B-Instant handles result reranking.\nProcessing the full dataset took approximately two\nhours; per-instance took about 20 to 30 seconds\nwith latency depends on the volume of retrieved\nevidence. For each query, 3–5 search queries are\ngenerated for the Tavily Search API. Raw text\nis extracted via the Trafilatura library, and the\nevidence block E is synthesized from the top-5\nreranked snippets.\n4.2.2\nEvaluation\nNear-Miss Construction.\nFor discriminative\nevaluation, we adopt a near-miss pairwise setting.\nEach query is associated with a reference answer\nXref and a candidate Xcand that differs by exactly\none critical clinical fact, with all other content held\nconstant.

We study the fol-\nlowing question: Can instance-specific rubrics im-\nprove response quality via rubric-guided refine-\nment? This setting reflects a realistic deployment\nscenario, where an initial response is refined with-\nout re-generation.\n6.1\nTask Setup and Baselines\nWe utilize a subset of 254 medical queries from\nHealthBench.\nFor each query, we generate a\nfixed base response using Llama-3.1-8B-Instant\n(T = 0.7, top_p = 0.9).\nBase responses are\nfrozen across all methods, and no re-sampling or\nre-generation is performed, ensuring that any im-\nprovement arises solely from refinement.\nIn addition to GPT-4o generated rubrics (see Sec-\ntion 4.3), we extend our comparison to include two\ncritical control settings that establish the perfor-\nmance bounds: Self-Critique (No-Rubric Base-\nline), which measures intrinsic self-correction ca-\npability (Madaan et al., 2023). In Self-Critique,\nthe model is prompted to identify weaknesses and\npropose improvements based solely on its internal\nknowledge, without access to any external rubric.\nThis serves as a lower-bound control to verify the\nnecessity of explicit guidance. Reference Rubric\n(Oracle Upper Bound)., which utilizes the ex-\npert physician-authored rubrics provided by Health-\nBench to guide the refinement. Since these repre-\nsent the ground truth standard, this setting serves\nas an Oracle, indicating the theoretical maximum\nperformance achievable when ideal guidance is pro-\nvided.\n6.2\nRefinement Mechanism\nTo transform a scoring rubric into an actionable\nediting tool, we employ a two-step Critique-then-\nRefine protocol:\nRubric-to-Critique Transformation.\nGiven a\nuser query Q, base response Xbase, and rubric, we\nuse an evaluator model (Llama-3.3-70B) reviews\nthe base response Xbase against the provided rubric\nR to output a structured Edit Plan (JSON). This\nedit plan explicitly lists prioritized actions (e.g.,\n\"ADD warning about drug interaction\", \"REMOVE\nunsupported claim\") while strictly adhering to the\nrubric’s criteria.\nConstraint-Guided\nRefinement.\nAn\neditor\nmodel (Llama-3.1-8B) executes the Edit Plan to\nproduce Xrefined.\nWe enforce strict behavioral\nconstraints: the editor must revise the response\nby applying only the instructions in the plan.\nIt is explicitly prohibited from introducing\nnew medical facts or definitive diagnoses not\npresent in the original context, thereby preventing\nrefinement-induced hallucinations.\n6.3\nEvaluation Protocol\nRefinement is strictly decoupled from evaluation.\nOriginal and refined responses are assessed inde-\npendently by an external LLM judge, ensuring\nthat observed gains can be causally attributed to\nrubric-guided refinement. The judge assesses the\nresponses based on the gold-standard physician-\nauthored criteria provided by HealthBench, rather\nthan the automatically generated rubrics used for\nrefinement.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Self-Critique\nGPT-4o rubric\nOur rubric\nReference rubric\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nScore (%)\n64.4\n65.7\n68.2\n74.1\nHealthBench Downstream Performance\nCommunication quality\nInstruction following\nAccuracy\nContext awareness\nCompleteness\nFigure 3: Dimension-wise analysis of downstream response refinement under different rubric settings, including\noverall performance trends and trade-offs across evaluation dimensions.\n6.4\nResponse Refinement Results\nFinally, we assess whether higher-quality rubrics\ntranslate into better downstream response refine-\nment. Table 3 reports performance improvements\nwhen responses are revised under different rubric\nguidance.\nRubric-guided refinement consistently outper-\nforms self-critique without rubrics. Our rubrics\nyield the largest improvement among automatic\nmethods and substantially close the gap to\nphysician-authored reference rubrics, which serve\nas an oracle upper bound.\nFigure 3 further illustrates dimension-wise ef-\nfects. Improvements are most pronounced in fac-\ntual dimensions such as accuracy and completeness,\nwhile gains in communication-related dimensions\nare more modest. Compared to reference rubrics,\nour rubrics achieve a better balance between factual\nimprovement and communication quality, suggest-\ning reduced trade-offs between information cover-\nage and readability.\n7\nConclusion\nWe presented a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent\nframework for automatically generating instance-\nspecific evaluation rubrics for medical dialogue.\nBy grounding rubric construction in authoritative\nmedical evidence and explicitly separating clinical\nconstraints from interaction-level requirements, our\napproach produces structured, interpretable rubrics\nthat better reflect case-specific clinical priorities.\nEmpirical results on HealthBench show that the\ngenerated rubrics achieve stronger clinical cover-\nage of gold key points and improved discrimina-\ntive ability in distinguishing high-quality responses\nfrom minimally flawed alternatives, compared to\ngeneric or directly generated rubrics. Beyond evalu-\nation, we further demonstrate that instance-specific\nrubrics can function as actionable feedback, en-\nabling controlled response refinement without re-\ngeneration.\nTogether, these findings suggest that automatic\nrubric generation offers a scalable and transpar-\nent foundation for medical LLM evaluation, bridg-\ning the gap between fine-grained clinical assess-\nment and large-scale automated judging. We hope\nthis work encourages further exploration of rubric-\ncentered evaluation and its role in both assessing\nand improving medical language models.\nLimitations\nOur study is subject to several limitations. First,\nexperiments are conducted on HealthBench and\nfocus on English medical dialogue, and further val-\nidation is needed to assess generalization across\nother datasets, languages, and clinical special-\nties. Second, the framework relies on retrieval\nfrom a curated set of authoritative medical sources,\nwhich may limit coverage for emerging or less-\ndocumented clinical scenarios.
