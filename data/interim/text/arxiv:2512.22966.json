Yet diagnostic and therapeutic errors remain alarmingly prevalent: \napproximately 795,000 Americans su]er permanent disability or death annually across \nhealthcare systems due to misdiagnosed conditions 1. Such failures may arise from time \npressures, the overwhelming volume of information clinicians must process in real time, \nclinicians’ overconﬁdence, or miscommunication 2,3. General-purpose LLMs have emerged \nas a potentially transformative paradigm that can help mitigate these challenges by \naugmenting provider judgment. Trained on vast corpora of text and ﬁne-tuned through \nmethods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), these models have \ndemonstrated prominent capabilities in understanding and generating natural language 4. \nLLMs have also exhibited emergent behaviors such as in-context learning and \ncompositional reasoning that extend well beyond mere memorization and both traditional \nand modern Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDS) 5-7. These properties \nmake them uniquely suited to the inherently ambiguous and multifaceted nature of clinical \ndecision-making, where structured reasoning must frequently be applied under conditions \nof uncertainty. \nRecent studies have highlighted this potential by documenting the strong performance of \nLLMs on standardized medical knowledge assessment tests. Models such as OpenAI’s \nGPT-4 8, Meta’s LIama9, and Google’s Gemini 10 have achieved expert-level accuracy on \nbenchmarks including the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) and \nMedQA, in some cases matching or surpassing the performance of trained physicians in \nmultiple-choice testing environments 11,12. These ﬁndings indicate the breadth of medical \nknowledge encoded within modern LLMs. \nPrompt engineering has been recognized as a means of reﬁning LLM behavior. Structured \nprompting strategies—such as chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and few-shot prompting—\nhave been shown to enhance accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and improve logical \ncoherence in both medical and non-medical tasks13,14. Notably, the MedPrompt framework \nhas demonstrated promising results in complex medical exam settings by dynamically \nselecting CoT exemplars and applying ensembling techniques 15. These methods represent \na model-agnostic, low-cost strategy for improving reasoning without additional training. \nHowever, success on knowledge-based examinations does not equate to proﬁciency in \nreal-world clinical reasoning. E]ective decision-making at the bedside requires the \nintegration of patient-speciﬁc data, prioritization under uncertainty, and the timing and \narrangement of diagnostic test and therapeutic interventions—skills that are highly \ncontext-dependent, temporally sensitive, and not amenable to factual recall 16-19. Thus, \n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "while strong exam performance represents a notable milestone, it is insu]icient to \nestablish clinical safety or utility. Most evaluations of prompt engineering to date remain \nconﬁned to these standard medical benchmarks and a narrow range of tasks, focusing \nprimarily on di]erential or ﬁnal diagnoses. Moreover, approaches such as MedPrompt have \nbeen tested almost exclusively on OpenAI models like ChatGPT 15, and while these \nmethods are model agnostic, their generalizability to other LLM architectures has not been \nexplored. This underscores the pressing need for systematic, task-level evaluations that \nassess how di]erent prompting strategies inﬂuence LLM performance across the full \nspectrum of clinical workﬂow. \nIn this study, we aimed to address this gap by systematically evaluating the performance of \nthree state-of-the-art LLMs—ChatGPT-4o, LIama 3.3 70B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro—across all \nkey stages of clinical reasoning using both baseline prompting and prompt engineering \napproaches.

For each decision-making task, \nLLMs were provided with progressively richer clinical input: initially, HPI, ROS, and PE for \ndi]erential diagnosis; subsequently, HPI, ROS, and PE along with the ground truth for \ndi]erential diagnosis (available from clinical vignettes) for essential immediate steps; then, \nall prior information plus ground truth for essential immediate steps for relevant diagnostic \ntesting; and so forth for each subsequent task. This ensured the model had access to all \npertinent context as it moved through the clinical reasoning sequence.

Conversely, relevant diagnostic testing likely \nproved the most di]icult because it requires a higher cognitive load: the model must \nreason under uncertainty, weigh the potential diagnostic yield of multiple test options, and \nstrategize the most e]icient path to a diagnosis. This highlights the di]iculty of a \nfundamentally di]erent type of reasoning compared to ﬁnal diagnosis: making decisions \nunder uncertainty. \nModel accuracy was robust to temperature changes, though the choice remains \ncritical for clinical applications: Our initial rationale for including the zero temperature \nsetting in our analysis was that reduced variability in model outputs might help ensure \nmore consistent and reproducible clinical reasoning, which is particularly valuable in high-\nstakes healthcare environments. On the other hand, zero temperature may also \ncompromise the performance as it could potentially favor more conservative or \nprototypical responses, impacting the breadth or creativity of the model's clinical \nreasoning. Examining both settings allowed us to explore whether certain clinical reasoning \ntasks beneﬁt from more predictable, consistent responses (high determinism) versus \nallowing for a more ﬂexible and broader range of potential solutions (greater adaptability). \nOur analysis identiﬁed subtle model-speciﬁc trends between temperature settings. For \nexample, ChatGPT-4o exhibited a slight decline in performance under default temperature \nacross all tasks except di]erential diagnosis, whereas LIama 3.3 70B performed slightly \nbetter under default temperature for all tasks excepts ﬁnal diagnosis. Nonetheless, none of \n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "the observed di]erences in accuracy between the default and zero temperature settings \nwere statistically signiﬁcant (paired Mannh-Whitney U, p < 0.05) across any of the tasks \nand the observed changes were all marginal. This suggests that model accuracy is mostly \nrobust to this hyperparameter within the scope of the MSD dataset. However, the choice of \ntemperature setting remains clinically signiﬁcant; while subtle performance trends were \nobserved in our study, the decision to prioritize deterministic, reproducible outputs over \nmore varied responses will be a critical consideration for the safe and reliable deployment \nof these models in clinical workﬂows. This warrants further explorations across larger and \nmore diverse datasets. \nStructured prompting can degrade performance by over-constraining a model’s \nreasoning process: A key ﬁnding of our study is that while MedPrompt’s structured prompt \nengineering aims to guide models toward more systematic reasoning, it does not \nuniversally improve model performance, and in several cases, it can paradoxically be \ncounterproductive, particularly when the prompts impose elaborate reasoning sca]olds or \ndemand tight alignment between example semantics. For instance, ChatGPT 4o’s \nperformance degraded under MedPrompt with both 𝐾NN and random dynamic few-shots \nfor all tasks except relevant diagnostic testing, while Gemini 1.5 Pro and LIama 3.3 70B \nresponded more favorably to prompt engineering (Figure 4).  Llama 3.3 70B especially \nbeneﬁted from prompt engineering for all tasks except for treatment recommendation.  \nPerformance drops when subjected to prompt engineering was most evident for ChatGPT-\n4o.  For instance, its accuracy in treatment recommendation fell sharply from 71.0% to \n50.2% with MedPrompt using 𝐾NN dynamic few-shot prompting (Figure 4). This e]ect is \nnot unique to one model or one task; Llama 3.3 70B's performance also degraded in \ntreatment recommendation with prompting strategies, and Gemini 1.5 Pro experienced a \nsharp accuracy drop in di]erential diagnosis when using MedPrompt with 𝐾NN dynamic \nfew-shot examples. This indicates that even models that beneﬁt from advanced prompting \nin some scenarios, can be impaired by it in others. These observations suggest a \nphenomenon of \"cognitive forcing\" e]ect, where the structured, step-by-step reasoning \nimposed by the MedPrompt framework may interfere with and override a model's e]ective, \npre-trained heuristics. This hypothesis is supported by emerging ﬁndings in the broader \nLLM literature that forcing models into rigid, structured reasoning paths can undermine \ntheir natural reasoning process 21,22. For example, both Shao et al 23 and Kim et. al 21 argue \nthat CoT functions as a structural constraint that drives models to mimic reasoning \npatterns rather than engage in genuine, ﬂexible, and novel inference pathways.  \nAnother notable observation was that MedPrompt with the more targeted 𝐾NN dynamic \nfew-shots did not always outperform that with random dynamic few-shots. This ﬁnding \n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "indicates that relying solely on semantic similarity to select few-shot examples may not \nalways yield the best results for model performance. The reason for this unexpected \nobservation could be that the presumed advantage of closely matched examples can be \no]set in some cases by the loss of broader contextual diversity or alternative reasoning \nstrategies. These mixed outcomes are in contrast to the consistent improvements reported \nin the original MedPrompt paper for medical knowledge exams 15 and highlight the intricate \ninterplay between model architecture, the speciﬁc clinical reasoning task, and the chosen \nprompting strategy in real-world clinical scenarios. \nPrompt engineering acted as e8ective sca8olding for tasks with high uncertainty: \nPrompt engineering provided substantial beneﬁts for the single most challenging task: \nrelevant diagnostic testing. Across all three models, which showed very low baseline \nscores on this task, the prompting frameworks—MedPrompt with both 𝐾NN and random \ndynamic few-shots—acted as a form of “cognitive sca]olding”, guiding the models through \na reasoning process where their baseline capabilities were weakest. For example, the \naccuracy of Gemini 1.5 Pro for relevant diagnostic testing surged from 46.5% to 71.5% with \nMedPrompt using 𝐾NN few-shots (a 25.0% improvement). This suggests that when a model \nlacks a robust internal strategy for a high-uncertainty task, the explicit structure of a \nprompt is highly beneﬁcial.  \nTogether, the results of our evaluation of LLMs performance when subjected to prompt \nengineering highlight that prompting strategies must be tailored—both to the speciﬁc \nmodel and the clinical task at hand.  \nThe study's ﬁndings should be interpreted in the context of several key limitations: It is \nimportant to consider several limitations when interpreting out ﬁndings in this study. First, \nthe evaluation was conducted on a modest dataset of 36 clinical vignettes, with the \nsample size for some tasks, such as essential immediate steps, being as low as 12 cases. \nWhile su]icient for this exploratory analysis, this small sample size limits the statistical \npower of our comparisons and increases the chance of Type II errors, which may obscure \nsubtle but clinically meaningful performance di]erences. This reinforces the need for \nlarger-scale evaluations. Second, the clinical cases were sourced from the MSD Manual, \nwhich is an evidence-based educational resource. Although this ensures high-quality and \nwell-structured data, these vignettes do not fully represent the diversity, complexity, \nambiguity, and noise of real-world clinical practice, which often involves incomplete or \ncontradictory information from electronic health records. Third, model performance was \nassessed using a performance metric deﬁned for the degree of overlap between predicted \nmultiple-choice answers and ground truth. This quantitative approach, while objective, \ndoes not capture the qualitative aspects of the models' outputs, such as the coherence, \n"}, {"page": 15, "text": "safety, or clinical appropriateness of their underlying reasoning. Finally, our prompt \nengineering framework relied on static LLM-generated CoT examples and did not include \nreal-time clinician feedback or reinforcement mechanisms, which may limit safety and \nadaptability in dynamic clinical environments. \nConclusions \nThis study demonstrates that strong LLM performance on medical knowledge exams does \nnot necessarily translate to e]ective application in real-world clinical encounters. It also \npresents a critical insight for the integration of LLMs into clinical workﬂows: there is no \n“one-size-ﬁts-all” solution for optimizing LLM performance in clinical decision-making.  \nOur results indicate that the e]ectiveness of both the language models and prompting \nstrategies to guide them are highly dependent on the speciﬁc clinical task at hand. This \nimplies that the path toward safe and e]ective clinical AI involves the development of \ntailored approaches that pair the right model with a relevant prompting strategy to the right \ntask, rather than a search for a single, universally optimal model or prompting technique. \nThese insights can guide healthcare systems, AI developers, and regulatory bodies in \noptimizing LLM deployment for safe and e]ective use in medicine. Future research can \nexpand on this work by incorporating larger-scale and more diverse datasets to better \nreﬂect real-world clinical complexity. Additionally, integrating human-in-the-loop \nreﬁnement and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) are essential for \nbuilding clinician trust and ensuring safe implementation of LLMs in healthcare.  \nMethods \nData sources: The dataset used in this study was sourced from the Merck Sharpe & \nDohme (MSD) Clinical Manual Professional Version 20. The MSD Manual is a widely \nrecognized, evidence-based medical resource authored by subject matter experts and \npeer-reviewed prior to publication. It provides comprehensive clinical information across a \nwide range of specialties and is commonly used by healthcare professionals for education \nand decision support. A total of 36 clinical cases were available in this database at the time \nthe study was conducted, each representing an individual patient case. The cases were \nextracted using web-scrapping in Python. These cases are structured to reﬂect realistic \nclinical scenarios and include key components of a standard patient encounter, such as \nHPI, ROS, PE results, and, where applicable, laboratory data. \nLLMs examined: We evaluated the performance of three leading LLMs: two commercial \nmodels—ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)—and one open-source \nmodel—LIama 3.3 70B (Meta). Each model was accessed through its respective API. For \nChatGPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, we used o]icial API endpoints provided by OpenAI and \n"}, {"page": 16, "text": "Google, respectively. Requests were made using Python scripts through the openai and \ngoogle.generativeai libraries. For the open-source LIama 3.1 70B model, we employed \nthe LIamaapi Python SDK, accessing the model via the LIamaAPI platform. API requests \nwere structured as JSON objects specifying the model’s name, prompt messages, and \nfunction-calling parameters.  \nPrompting LLMs: Each clinical vignette was input into the model as a single continuous \nsession to preserve contextual continuity. A new session was initialized for each case to \navoid cross-contamination of responses between vignettes. Questions involving visual \ndata, such as medical images, were excluded from analysis. Clinical decision-making \ntasks were ordered as follows: di]erential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant \ndiagnostic testing, ﬁnal diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. These tasks were \npresented to the models as a sequential series of prompts, where the input to the model \nfor each clinical decision-making task included HPI, ROS, PE results, along with the ground \ntruth for all preceding tasks, to simulate the stepwise reasoning process typical of real-\nworld clinical encounters. For example, model inputs for di]erential diagnosis were HPI, \nROS, and PE results. The inputs to the next clinical task, essential immediate steps, \nincluded HPI, ROS, and PE results as well as the ground truth for di]erential diagnosis. \nEach question was tested three times (each in a new session) to account for potential \nvariability in responses. The model’s output for each trial was compared against a \npredeﬁned set of correct answers extracted from the MSD database. Notably, not all case \nstudies included all ﬁve question types; in such instances, the model was directed to \nproceed to the next available question type. The number of clinical vignettes for each \ncategory of questions is: 36 in essential di]erential diagnosis, 12 in essential immediate \nsteps, 21 in relevant diagnostic testing, 33 in ﬁnal diagnosis, and 32 in treatment ordering. \nPrompt engineering: Prior to applying prompt engineering, we ﬁrst constructed a training \ndataset by identifying question instances for which the model’s self-generated CoT \nreasoning produced an answer that matched the ground truth answer. Speciﬁcally, we \nprompted each LLM with the instruction “Let’s think step by step.” to elicit CoT reasoning. \nFrom the resulting output, we extracted the model’s ﬁnal answer and compared it to the \ncorrect answer for each question type. If the model’s answer matched the ground truth, the \ninstance was included in the training set. Otherwise, it was assigned to the test set. For \neach question type, approximately 30% of the cases were allocated to the training set, \nwhile the remaining cases were reserved for testing. In situations where the self-generated \nCoT did not yield a su]icient number of high-quality training examples, we supplied the \ncorrect answer to the model and prompted it to generate a corresponding CoT explanation. \nThese synthetically augmented CoT examples were included in the training set until the \n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "desired sample size was achieved. Once the training set was ﬁnalized, we applied the \nstructured MedPrompt prompting techniques to evaluate performance on the test set. \nFor 𝐾NN dynamic few-shot learning introduced and utilized in MedPrompt 15, we ﬁrst \ncomputed vector representations of both training and test set questions using the OpenAI’s \nclient.embeddings.create() function. Three few-shot examples were then selected for \neach test question based on cosine similarity, prioritizing examples that were semantically \nsimilar to the target test question in terms of clinical context. Answer to these questions \nalready involved CoT explanation generated by the respective LLM under evaluation.  \nIn addition to the original MedPrompt framework, which involved 𝐾NN dynamic few-short \nprompting 15, we also examined a variant of MedPrompt, where we replaced the 𝐾NN \ndynamic few-shot prompting with random dynamic-shot prompting, where the examples \nfrom the training dataset for each test question were selected randomly for few-shot \nlearning. For ensemble shu]ling ensemble, another key component of MedPrompt, answer \nchoices were shu]led to minimize answer-order bias. Three prompt variants with shu]led \nanswer choices were generated and aggregated in an ensemble framework for robust \nevaluation.  \nPerformance evaluation: Model performance for questions with multiple answer choices \n(di]erential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, treatment \nrecommendation) was calculated based on the percent overlap between the model-\ngenerated responses and the ground truth answers in the MSD database. This allowed us to \naward partial credit to LLMs when the model’s answer intersected with the correct set but \nwas not fully correct. For example, in di]erential diagnosis questions, if the ground truth \nlisted ﬁve possible conditions (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, asthma, heart \nfailure, and bronchitis) and the model correctly identiﬁed three of them (e.g., pneumonia, \nasthma, and heart failure), then the performance score for that instance would be \ncalculated as the proportion of correct predictions: 3 out of 5, or 60%. Each clinical \nquestion was evaluated over three independent runs to account for potential variability in \nmodel responses. The individual question score was computed as the average accuracy \nacross these three runs. To derive the overall performance for each question type, we \ncalculated the mean accuracy across all relevant questions within that category.  \nFor ﬁnal diagnosis, where there was a single correct answer choice per case, the model’s \nanswer for each clinical case was directly compared with MSD correct answers, labeling 0 \n(incorrect) or 1(correct). The average score was calculated for the result accuracy.  \n"}, {"page": 18, "text": "All baseline prompting, prompt engineering, and performance evaluation implementations \nwere conducted within Google Colaboratory and can be accessed in Supplementary File \n2. \nStatistical methods: To evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of performance di]erences \nbetween LLMs under di]erent prompting strategies or temperature settings, we conducted \nstatistical hypothesis testing using the paired Mann-Whitney U (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank) test \nbetween the evaluation results for both zero and default temperature.
