To further ad-\nvance toward fully AI Doctor assistant, these mod-\nels must perceive, reason, and interact from an ego-\ncentric perspective that mirrors real-world clinical\nworkflows.\n*Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding Author.\nFigure 1: MedGaze-Bench with three-dimensional clin-\nical intent understanding capability evaluation from spa-\ntial, temporal to medical standard.\nHowever, existing benchmarks fall short in\nevaluating such capabilities.\nWhile datasets\nlike EgoSurgery (Fujii et al., 2024) and POV-\nSurgery (Wang et al., 2023) support specific visual\ntasks, they do not evaluate Med-MLLMs’ intent un-\nderstanding capacity, i.e., the underlying purpose\nand rationale behind clinician actions across di-\nverse scenarios ranging from surgical interventions\nto diagnostic interpretations. Therefore, systematic\nbenchmarks are needed to evaluate Med-MLLMs’\ncapabilities in understanding clinician actions.\nTo construct an effective evaluation framework,\nwe should first analyze three intrinsic challenges\nin egocentric medical scenarios that hinder intent\nunderstanding:\n(1) High Visual Homogeneity and Ambiguity:\nIn operative fields and diagnostic displays, targets\noften lack distinct visual boundaries. Nerves and\nvessels exhibit similar textures in surgery (Maier-\nHein et al., 2022), while subtle pathological signs\n1\narXiv:2601.06750v1  [cs.CV]  11 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "blend with healthy tissue in diagnostics (Yan et al.,\n2018). Global features alone cannot distinguish the\nclinician’s immediate focus from visually dominant\nsurroundings. Hence, we should define both global\nlocalization and relative localization task.\n(2) Strict Temporal and Causal Dependency:\nClinical actions are rarely isolated; they are linked\nby inherent causal necessities (Liu et al., 2023).\nAchieving hemostasis before closure in surgery, or\nlocalizing lesions before characterization in diag-\nnostics (Kundel et al., 1978), exemplifies manda-\ntory sequential dependencies. Models must un-\nderstand that violating this temporal order is not\nmerely a stylistic error, but a fundamental failure\nin clinical reasoning.\n(3) Implicit Standardization based on Guide-\nlines: Clinical actions follow Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs) with latent safety logic. In vagi-\nnal breech delivery, specific hand movements (e.g.,\nLovset or Mauriceau maneuvers) are mandated by\nobstetric guidelines to prevent complications (Lat-\nifzadeh et al., 2025; Becker, 2025), not arbitrary\nchoices. Failing to grasp the latent safety logic be-\nhind these standardized motions prevents models\nfrom truly comprehending the procedure.\nTo fulfill these requirement, we introduce\nMedGaze-Bench, the first medical benchmark de-\nsigned to evaluate MLLMs’ capabilities in egocen-\ntric clinical intent understanding. It is constructed\nfrom three distinct clinical scenarios: unstructured\nreal-world open surgery (20 procedures by 8 sur-\ngeons), standardized emergency simulation (breech\ndelivery by 5 obstetricians), and fine-grained di-\nagnostic cognition (Chest X-ray and Mammogra-\nphy interpretation). Despite their heterogeneity, we\nidentify a unifying cognitive thread: the Gaze. We\nconceptualize Gaze as a “Cognitive Cursor”—a\ndynamic proxy bridging raw visual stimuli and\nhigh-level clinical reasoning. A clinician’s gaze\nexplicitly indicates their implicit reasoning: it fil-\nters visual noise (Spatial), reveals procedural an-\nticipation (Temporal), and verifies safety protocols\n(Standard).\nWe establish the Three-Dimensional Clinical\nIntent Framework evaluating how MLLMs syn-\nthesize visual stimuli into actionable reasoning\nfrom spatial, temporal, and medical standard per-\nspectives (Figure 1). First, Spatial Intent Under-\nstanding addresses visual ambiguity (the \"Where\")\nthrough Discriminative Grounding, requiring mod-\nels to filter visual noise and identify precise anatom-\nical targets via Absolute Localization while de-\ncoding surrounding spatial logic via Relative Lo-\ncalization. Moreover, Temporal Intent Under-\nstanding tackles causal dependency (the \"Why\")\nthrough Causal Rationale, evaluating whether mod-\nels perform Retrospective Attribution to deduce\nprerequisite conditions justifying current actions\nand Prospective Anticipation to forecast opera-\ntional goals driving next steps, transcending mere\nchronological sequence. Furthermore, Standard\nIntent Understanding captures SOP adherence\n(the \"How\") through Protocol Alignment, decom-\nposed into Discrete Safety Verification for momen-\ntary checking of critical landmarks and Continuous\nSafety Vigilance for sustained monitoring of vul-\nnerable non-target areas.\nWe conduct extensive evaluation of 9 MLLMs\non MedGaze-Bench, revealing that current MLLMs\nfrequently fail to interpret clinical intent from ego-\ncentric videos. Several obtained insights offer po-\ntential direction of Med-MLLMs. Our contribu-\ntions are as follows:\n• We introduce MedGaze-Bench, the first bench-\nmark utilizing clinician gaze as a “Cognitive\nCursor” to bridge the critical gap between pas-\nsive egocentric perception and active clinical\nreasoning.\n• We propose a unified framework evaluating\nSpatial, Temporal, and Standard Intent Under-\nstanding. This structure systematically quan-\ntifies how models handle visual ambiguity,\ncausal dependency, and rigorous safety proto-\ncols.\n• Beyond standard accuracy, we design a dual-\nlevel evaluation strategy featuring a novel\n“Trap QA” mechanism. This explicitly stress-\ntests clinical reliability, strictly penalizing\nmodels for perceptual hallucinations and cog-\nnitive sycophancy.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nGeneral VideoQA Benchmarks\nVideo Question Answering (VideoQA) has evolved\nsignificantly, transitioning from identifying atomic\nvisual patterns to requiring high-level cognitive\nsynthesis. While foundational benchmarks estab-\nlished the groundwork for cross-modal alignment\nthrough tasks like action recognition (Caba Heil-\nbron et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2023) and video cap-\ntioning (Takahashi et al., 2024), they often treated\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Table 1: Comparison with representative egocentric and medical benchmarks.\nBenchmark\nData Scale\nView\nGaze\nIntent Reasoning Capabilities\nVideos\nQA Pairs\nPersp.\nSource\nSpatial\nTemporal\nStandard\nGeneral Domain\nQaEgo4D (Bärmann and Waibel, 2022)\n166\n1,854\nEgo\n✗†\n✓\n✓\n✗\nEgoMemoria (Ye et al., 2024a)\n629\n7,026\nEgo\n✗†\n✓\n✓\n✗\nECBench (Dang et al., 2025)\n386\n4,324\nEgo\n✗†\n✓\n✓\n✗\nEOC-Bench (Yuan et al., 2025)\n656\n3,277\nEgo\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nEgoTextVQA (Zhou et al., 2025)\n1,507\n7,064\nEgo\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\nEgoGazeVQA (Peng et al., 2025)\n913\n1,757\nEgo\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✗\nMedical Domain\nCholec80 (Maier-Hein et al., 2022)\n80\n~43,182\nNon-ego\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\nEndoBench (Liu et al., 2025)\n6,832‡\n6,832\nNon-ego\n✗\n✓\n✗\n✗\nEgoSurgery (Fujii et al., 2024)\n571\n-\nEgo\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\nEgoExOR (Özsoy et al., 2025)\n41\n-\nEgo\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\nMedGaze-Bench\n775\n4,491\nEgo\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nView Persp.: Ego=Egocentric, Endo=Endoscopic.

To address this lim-\nitation, recent benchmarks such as MVBench (Li\net al., 2024b) and Video-MME (Fu et al., 2025)\nhave expanded the scope to include temporal\ngrounding and long-context understanding across\ndiverse daily scenarios. However, despite the shift\ntowards more complex reasoning (Hu et al., 2025),\ncurrent general VideoQA benchmarks remain pre-\ndominantly constrained by a third-person \"specta-\ntor\" perspective. This observation angle creates\nan inherent information asymmetry, lacking the\negocentric immersion and fine-grained cognitive\nsignals—specifically gaze—required to decode the\nimplicit intent of professional practitioners in high-\nstakes environments.\n2.2\nMedical VideoQA Benchmarks\nThe rapid proliferation of Medical Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (Med-MLLMs) has\nspurred the development of diverse evaluation\nsuites.\nWhile broad-spectrum benchmarks like\nGMAI-MMBench (Ye et al., 2024b) and MediCon-\nfusion (Sepehri et al., 2024) have established base-\nlines for modality coverage and discriminative ro-\nbustness, significant efforts have also been directed\ntowards dynamic surgical environments. Special-\nized benchmarks, including SurgicalVQA (Seeni-\nvasan et al., 2022) and EndoBench (Liu et al.,\n2025), have advanced the field by aggregating\ndatasets to evaluate geometric localization and pro-\ncedural phase analysis. Nevertheless, these exist-\ning works remain predominantly constrained by a\npost-hoc \"observer bias\". They rely on external\nannotations that describe what is happening (e.g.,\ntool presence or phase labels) but fail to capture\nwhy the clinician acted at that specific moment,\neffectively detaching visual input from the clini-\ncian’s active cognitive process. MedGaze-Bench\naddresses this critical gap by introducing an egocen-\ntric, gaze-centric paradigm, shifting the evaluation\nfrom passive event observation to active intent un-\nderstanding. Table 1 provides a systematic compar-\nison, highlighting that our MedGaze-Bench is the\nfirst to uniquely integrate egocentric vision, authen-\ntic gaze signals, and SOP-based intent verification.\n2.3\nGaze in Clinical Cognition\nIn the medical domain, gaze extends beyond a mere\npoint of visual fixation; it acts as a physical man-\nifestation of systematic reasoning, rooted in the\n\"Eye-Mind Hypothesis\" (Anderson et al., 2004).\nBuilding on this cognitive link, recent approaches\nhave integrated gaze signals to enhance model ro-\nbustness. For instance, Wang et al. (Wang et al.,\n2025a) aligned visual representations with human\ngaze during self-supervised pre-training to prior-\nitize clinical features, while Ma et al. (Ma et al.,\n2023) employed gaze guidance to rectify \"short-\ncut learning\" in Vision Transformers. Parallel to\nthese diagnostic advances, the surgical domain has\ntransitioned towards first-person video analysis to\ncapture the immersive nature of procedures. Bench-\nmarks like EgoSurgery (Fujii et al., 2024) have pio-\nneered fine-grained action recognition from the sur-\ngeon’s perspective. However, these works typically\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Figure 2: MedGaze-Bench, a three-dimensional evaluation system for clinical intent understanding based on\ngaze tracking across four medical scenarios.

This hierarchical design\nensures that MedGaze-Bench moves beyond sim-\nple visual description to rigorously stress-test the\ncognitive depth of MLLMs.\n3.2\nData Collection and Curation\nTo ensure ecological validity and cognitive breadth,\nwe curate a multi-modal dataset spanning two dis-\ntinct clinical scenarios, followed by a rigorous har-\nmonization process.\nSource Diversity and Alignment. We integrate\ndata from four expert-annotated sources. For dy-\nnamic interventional procedures, we incorporate\nthe Open Surgery Video Dataset (Fujii et al., 2024),\ncomprising 20 authentic procedures across 10 dis-\ntinct surgical types, and the Breech Delivery Sim-\nulation (Latifzadeh et al., 2025), featuring five\nstandardized scenarios of vaginal breech delivery.\nThese sources provide a dense reference corpus\nfor evaluating precise adherence to complex ma-\nneuvers. For static diagnostic radiology, we utilize\nthe MIMIC-Eye (Chest X-ray) (Hsieh et al., 2023)\nand Mammo-Gaze (Mammography) (Wang et al.,\n2025a) datasets. These record the precise fixation\ntrajectories of radiologists, efficiently bridging the\ngap between subtle pathological signs and expert\nvisual search patterns.\nUnified Processing and Generation Pipeline. We\nimplemented a streamlined strategy to synthesize\nheterogeneous clinical data into a standardized\nbenchmark. First, for Data Alignment, we struc-\ntured raw streams according to domain-specific\nlogic: interventional videos (open surgery/breech\ndelivery) were temporally segmented into semantic\nclips aligned with SOPs phases, while diagnos-\ntic data (Mammography/CXR) underwent spatial-\ntemporal synchronization, mapping ROIs to struc-\ntured attributes (e.g., BI-RADS) or audio dicta-\ntions. Second, for Question Generation, we de-\nvised a Gaze-Anchored Prompting mechanism via\nGPT-4o.

Results\nin Table 5 highlight three distinct behaviors. First,\nGeneralist models (Qwen3VL) demonstrate supe-\nrior instruction following, effectively linking the\ntextual command to the visual anchor to boost Stan-\ndard Intent (+3.95%). Second, Medical Specialists\nshow negligible gains (< 1%), indicating a rigidity\nwhere models rely on internal knowledge priors\nrather than the provided visual-textual guidance.\nThird, gaze ironically impairs EgoLife’s tempo-\nral reasoning (-0.66%). The model suffers from\na semantic mismatch, misinterpreting the specific\nprompt as a cue for immediate interaction (daily-\nlife bias) rather than surgical planning.\nQualitative Evaluation. Figure 4 highlights the\ncapabilities and safety gaps of MLLMs across the\nthree intent dimensions. In Spatial Intent, mod-\nels struggled with absolute localization in narrow\nsurgical fields, universally failing to identify the\nmandibular region, though GPT-5 and Lingshu\ndemonstrated stronger relative geometric reasoning\nin diagnostic imaging. Temporal Intent revealed\na tendency for “shortcut reasoning” in domain-\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Figure 4: Qualitative evaluation on three key clinical intent understanding tasks with six fine-grained sub-tasks.\nspecific models; while GPT-5 correctly anticipated\nthe intermediate need for hemostasis, others pre-\nmaturely suggested wound closure, and notably, all\nmodels failed to interpret the subtle visual cue of\nan abrupt pause, hallucinating non-existent smoke\nor thermal issues. Most critically, Standard Intent\nexposed significant safety risks: while GPT-5 and\nQwen correctly identified the safe maneuver for\nbreech delivery, Lingshu and Egolife recommended\n“Fundal”, a potentially dangerous contraindication,\nand only GPT-5 demonstrated the requisite vig-\nilance for tissue viability (mucosa color) during\nhemostasis, underscoring the gap between general\nmedical knowledge and precise, safety-critical situ-\national awareness.\n5\nDiscussion\nReliability remains the main bottleneck.Under\nthe Level 2 “Trap QA” protocol (Table 2), no\nevaluated model exceeds 70% average reliabil-\nity, indicating that even strong MLLMs remain\nfragile in safety-critical settings. The detailed re-\nsults (Table 4) further show complementary failure\nmodes—some models are better at avoiding option-\nlevel visual fabrication but remain vulnerable to\nquestion-level instruction sycophancy, implying\n“being accurate” does not guarantee “being safe”.\nTemporal intent shows strong causal asymmetry.\nIn the competency evaluation (Table 3), many mid-\nsized models achieve relatively strong performance\non Prospective Anticipation (often around 60%)\nbut collapse on Retrospective Attribution (often\naround 35%). This pattern suggests that current\nMLLMs behave as forward sequence predictors\nrather than true causal reasoners, failing to infer the\nprerequisite conditions that justify the current clini-\ncal action—exactly the type of causal dependency\nMedGaze-Bench is designed to test (Figure 2).\nGaze prompting helps, but unevenly across mod-\nels.The dual-prompting gaze strategy improves a\ngeneralist model consistently across Spatial/Tem-\nporal/Standard intent, with the largest gain on Stan-\ndard Intent (e.g., +3.95 for Qwen3VL; Table 5). In\ncontrast, medical-specific models show negligible\ngains (<1%; Table 5), suggesting they under-utilize\nexplicit attentional guidance, while the egocentric\nmodel can even degrade on temporal reasoning\n(-0.66; Table 5), consistent with the qualitative fail-\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "ure patterns reported in Figure 4. These support\ngaze as an effective grounding signal, but also indi-\ncate that current MLLMs vary substantially in how\nreliably they bind text instructions to egocentric\nvisual anchors.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduce MedGaze-Bench, the first benchmark\nto evaluate egocentric clinical intent understanding\nin Med-MLLMs. Our three-dimensional clinical\nintent framework reveals that current Med-MLLMs\nhave severe reliability gaps, dangerous hallucina-\ntions, and blindly accept invalid instructions by\nover-relying on global features instead of precise\nintent grounding.\n7\nLimitations\nWhile MedGaze-Bench establishes a foundation for\nevaluating egocentric clinical intent understanding,\nseveral limitations can be addressed in future work.\nFirst, our benchmark currently focuses on a limited\nset of clinical scenarios (open surgery, emergency\nsimulation, and diagnostic radiology), which could\nbe expanded to cover additional specialties such as\ninterventional cardiology, intensive care, or ambu-\nlatory consultations. Second, the current evaluation\nprotocol employs multiple-choice questions, which\nmay not fully capture the nuanced, open-ended rea-\nsoning required in real clinical decision-making;\nincorporating free-form generation tasks would pro-\nvide a more comprehensive assessment.\nReferences\nJohn R Anderson, Dan Bothell, and Scott Douglass.\n2004.

Seven prompt tem-\nplates are provided as examples.\nA\nDetails on Prompt Design and\nTemplates\nOur prompt construction pipeline follows a four-\nstage sequential process: clinical modeling →pur-\npose specification →content constraints →struc-\ntural constraints. This design ensures that the gen-\nerated questions cognitively mirror the intention-\ndriven decision-making of clinicians operating in\nreal-world settings. In the clinical modeling stage,\neach prompt begins with a first-person narrative\n(“I am...”) to explicitly assign the model a specific\nclinical role such as attending surgeon, obstetri-\ncian, or radiology mentor and dynamically embeds\nhigh-fidelity contextual details of the current sce-\nnario. These include the precise surgical procedure\n(e.g., “open cholecystectomy”), the exact phase\nwithin the standardized operative protocol (SOP),\nthe anatomical site, the number of available vi-\nsual frames, a summary of expert eye-gaze pat-\nterns, team configuration (e.g., “anesthesiologist\nis present; scrub nurse is handing the suction de-\nvice”), and relevant clinical guidelines (e.g., NICE\n2025 or ACOG 2024). This contextual grounding\nshifts question generation away from generic med-\nical knowledge recall and firmly anchors it to the\nspecific visual evidence provided.\nFollowing scene establishment, the prompt en-\nters the purpose specification stage, which clearly\ndefines the assessment objective for that template.\nWe developed seven specialized prompt templates\ncorresponding to seven distinct clinical evaluation\nscenarios: real-world open surgery; two phases\nof breech delivery simulation (pre-active wait-\ning phase and active pushing phase); interpreta-\ntion of chest X-rays and mammograms; and two\nrobustness-focused tasks—Perceptual Reliability\nand Cognitive Reliability. Each template includes\na tailored task description: for imaging interpreta-\ntion prompts, the goal is to guide the model toward\nidentifyingwhere critical evidence resides rather\nthan stating a diagnosis; for Perceptual Reliability,\nthe focus is on detecting whether the model erro-\nneously selects items that are clinically plausible\nbut absent from the visual frames; for Cognitive\nReliability, the emphasis is on evaluating whether\nthe model can recognize and reject false assump-\ntions embedded in the question that contradict the\nvisual evidence. To improve task fidelity, each\ntemplate also provides a small set of compliant ex-\nample utterances (e.g., “I have just called for the\nlaparoscopic grasper—but where exactly should I\nplace it?”) to illustrate how clinical intent should\nbe translated into valid first-person questions.\nIn the content constraints stage, we enforce strict\nsemantic and cognitive rules to ensure question\nquality and evaluative validity. The foremost re-\nquirement is mandatory use of the first-person “I”\nperspective: all questions must be phrased as “I\nneed to. . . ”, “I am unsure whether. . . ”, or “I should\ncheck. . . ”, avoiding third-person narration, passive\nvoice, or abstract descriptions. This preserves the\nimmediacy of the clinician’s in-the-moment cog-\nnitive state during procedural execution. Further-\nmore, each prompt must elicit exactly six questions\nthat collectively span all six sub-dimensions of\nour three-dimensional clinical intention framework.\nCritically, we enforce multimodal dependency: es-\npecially in surgical and simulation contexts, the\ncorrect answer must rely on the joint interpretation\nof image content and the visual focus indicated by\neye-gaze data. However, explicit coordinate refer-\nences (e.g., x=0.6 or point 3) are strictly prohibited\nin the question stem; instead, natural-language spa-\ntial references such as “in the area I’m currently\nlooking at” or “slightly left of center in my field\nof view” must be used. This design tests whether\nthe model can effectively integrate visual attention\nwith linguistic reasoning without exposing techni-\ncal artifacts.\nFinally, in the structural constraints stage, each\nprompt appends concise definitions of the six inten-\ntion sub-dimensions along with illustrative ques-\ntion templates, and mandates that the output adhere\nto a standardized JSON format.
