However, approx-\nimately 80% of EHR data is recorded as unstruc-\ntured text, including physician notes and imaging\nreports (Kong, 2019; Jensen et al., 2012). These\nnarratives contain rich descriptions of symptom\nevolution and clinical assessments, yet temporal\nchanges are often documented implicitly rather\nthan in structured form. Since many clinical out-\ncomes are defined retrospectively based on how\na patient’s condition evolves over time, effective\nFigure 1: Multi-dimensional Performance Profile.\nDementia-R1 demonstrates a consistent and balanced\nperformance gain across all dimensions, including inter-\nmediate clinical reasoning tasks (e.g., MMSE, CDR-SB,\nADAS-Cog) and the final dementia prognosis (F1-score)\nmodeling requires longitudinal analysis rather than\nreliance on information from a single visit. De-\nspite this need, most existing longitudinal disease\nmodeling frameworks are designed for structured\ndata representations and therefore struggle to sys-\ntematically incorporate unstructured clinical narra-\ntives (Waxler et al., 2025; Steinberg et al., 2024;\nShmatko et al., 2025).\nRecent advances in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nunderstanding unstructured medical text for clinical\ndecision support (Wachter and Brynjolfsson, 2024;\nSilcox et al., 2024).\nIn particular, LLM-based\nmethods achieve impressive performance on static,\nsnapshot-style benchmarks such as MedQA (Jin\net al., 2021), where inputs represent isolated clini-\ncal scenarios (Singhal et al., 2025). However, such\nbenchmarks largely ignore longitudinal disease pro-\ngression. This limitation is critical for diseases\n1\narXiv:2601.03018v1  [cs.CL]  6 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "characterized by slow and cumulative progression,\nsuch as dementia, where diagnosis requires inte-\ngrating evidence of cognitive and functional de-\ncline across multiple clinical encounters (Grand\net al., 2011; Borson et al., 2013; Knopman and\nPetersen, 2014). Crucially, these trajectories are of-\nten non-monotonic; clinical status may fluctuate or\ntemporarily improve, necessitating a holistic evalu-\nation of the patient’s condition rather than simple\nonset detection. In real-world practice, these longi-\ntudinal signals are predominantly documented in\nunstructured clinical notes rather than standardized\nfields, making dementia a particularly challeng-\ning testbed for longitudinal reasoning over clinical\ntext (Kruse et al., 2025a).\nTo\naddress\nthis\nchallenge,\nwe\nintroduce\nDementia-R1, a framework designed for longitudi-\nnal reasoning using LLMs through Reinforcement\nLearning (RL). We focus on dementia prognosis\nas a representative task of complex longitudinal\ndisease progression. Unlike acute diseases, demen-\ntia diagnosis requires tracking longitudinal cogni-\ntive and functional changes over months or years.\nThese signals are described in clinical narratives,\nyet they are difficult to quantify explicitly (Borson\net al., 2013; Knopman and Petersen, 2014). While\nstandard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) optimizes\nmodels to directly predict final labels, RL-based\nfine-tuning enables the model to learn reasoning\nprocesses before making a prediction (DeepSeek-\nAI, 2025; Shao et al., 2024), making it a natural\nfit for longitudinal clinical inference. However, di-\nrectly applying RL to a high-level binary prognosis\ntask (e.g., Dementia vs. Non-Dementia) is chal-\nlenging due to the sparsity of the reward signal and\nthe implicit nature of the underlying reasoning.\nWe address this issue through a Cold-Start RL\nstrategy with verifiable clinical rewards. Prior work\ntypically relies on SFT to introduce step-wise ratio-\nnales explicitly (Chen and et al., 2024; DeepSeek-\nAI, 2025). However, in the context of dementia\nprognosis, constructing rational trajectories is par-\nticularly challenging. Longitudinal reasoning re-\nquires temporally consistent analysis across multi-\nple visits and substantial effort from clinical experts\nto validate them (Kruse et al., 2025a). To miti-\ngate these challenges, we adopt an RL-based pre-\ntraining stage using clinically established indices as\nreward signals rather than explicit reasoning anno-\ntations. Specifically, we train the model to predict\nscores measured at each visit, such as the Mini-\nMental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al.,\n1975), Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (Reis-\nberg et al., 2022), and Clinical Dementia Rating\n(CDR) (Morris, 1993). By inferring these indices\nfrom longitudinal unstructured notes, the model au-\ntonomously acquires essential reasoning primitives,\nwhich are subsequently refined in a second stage\nfor the final dementia prediction task.\nWe validate our approach on both real-world un-\nstructured clinical notes from the Asan Medical\nCenter (AMC) real-world cohort and the structured\nbenchmark (ADNI) (Jack Jr et al., 2008). As illus-\ntrated in Figure 1, our model demonstrates compre-\nhensive multi-dimensional reasoning capabilities\ncompared to baselines. Our contributions are as\nfollows:\n• We propose Dementia-R1, an RL-based frame-\nwork that enables explicit temporal reasoning\non unstructured clinical notes to predict de-\nmentia prognosis.\n• We introduce a Cold-Start RL method using\nverifiable rewards, demonstrating that learn-\ning to estimate intermediate clinical scores is\ncrucial for an accurate dementia prognosis.\n• We validate our approach on both private real-\nworld unstructured datasets and a public struc-\ntured benchmark, demonstrating consistent\nimprovements over the strong baselines, in-\ncluding general-purpose LLMs and medical-\nspecialized reasoning models.\n2\nRelated Work\nLongitudinal Clinical Modeling.\nTraditional ap-\nproaches for longitudinal disease modeling have\nprimarily focused on structured electronic health\nrecords (EHRs), utilizing Recurrent Neural Net-\nworks (RNNs) to process temporal sequences\nof medical codes (Choi et al., 2016).\nRecent\nTransformer-based models have advanced longi-\ntudinal forecasting by leveraging large-scale struc-\ntured records for tasks such as time-to-events pre-\ndiction (Steinberg et al., 2024), disease trajectory\nmodeling (Shmatko et al., 2025), and medical\nevents modeling (Waxler et al., 2025). While these\nmodels show effectiveness for structured data, they\nfail to capture the nuanced behavioral and symp-\ntomatic descriptions found in unstructured clinical\nnotes, which constitute the majority of EHR data.\nRecent works such as NYUTron (Jiang et al., 2023)\nand CARE-AD (Li et al., 2025) have demonstrated\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Think\n1.

The pipeline consists of two phases: Stage 1: Cold-Start\nPre-training, where the base model learns longitudinal reasoning via GRPO on forecasting tasks; and Stage 2:\nTask Fine-tuning, where the reasoning-aligned model is adapted for the final dementia prediction task.\nthe potential of LLMs for longitudinal prediction\nusing unstructured clinical text. However, these\napproaches primarily optimize for final clinical out-\ncomes and do not explicitly train models to reason\nover intermediate disease trajectories or temporal\nprogression patterns. As a result, current frame-\nworks for unstructured clinical text still lack mech-\nanisms for explicit longitudinal reasoning (Kruse\net al., 2025b), motivating our approach.\nReasoning Capabilities of Medical LLMs.\nThe\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in the medical do-\nmain have been largely enhanced through Chain-of-\nThought (CoT) prompting, which encourages mod-\nels to generate intermediate rationales (Wei et al.,\n2022). HuatuoGPT-o1 (Chen and et al., 2024) fur-\nther improves medical reasoning by combining Su-\npervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning trajecto-\nries with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the gen-\neral domain, recent advances have shifted from SFT\nto RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), demon-\nstrating that models can learn reasoning when the\nreward is easily verifiable (DeepSeek-AI, 2025).\nHowever, applying this paradigm to clinical tasks\nremains challenging due to the sparsity of the re-\nward signal and the implicit nature of the required\nreasoning steps. C-Reason (Kim et al., 2025) par-\ntially addresses this challenge using Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) for\nsepsis management via masked value prediction;\nhowever, it does not address long-term disease pro-\ngression. We extend this line of work to longitu-\ndinal dementia prediction by training the model\nto track disease progression by estimating clinical\nscores before determining the final prognosis.\n3\nMethodology: Dementia-R1\nGiven a sequence of unstructured clinical notes\nH = {x1, x2, . . . , xt}, we formulate the task as\ndetermining the final clinical status y ∈{0, 1} at\na target anchor Tanchor, conditioned on the pa-\ntient’s history H<T = {xi|i < T, xi ∈H}. This\napproach requires distinguishing temporary fluc-\ntuations from persistent decline across the trajec-\ntory, rather than assuming simple linear progres-\nsion. To enable explicit reasoning over disease\nprogression, we employ a two-stage reinforcement\nlearning framework utilizing Group Relative Pol-\nicy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) with\nverifiable clinical rewards (see Figure 2).\n3.1\nConstructing Verifiable Pretraining Data\nSince raw unstructured text lacks explicit ground\ntruth for longitudinal reasoning, we construct a\npre-training dataset paired with verifiable clinical\nindices. We employ a strong auxiliary LLM as an\nextractor E to parse unstructured notes into struc-\ntured clinical scores:\nst = E(xt),\nst ∈S\n(1)\nwhere S represents the set of target indices:\nMMSE (0–30), GDS (1–7), and CDR (0–3). Using\nthese extracted values as ground truth, we generate\na pre-training dataset Dpre = {(H<t, st)} where\nthe model is trained to forecast the score st at the\ntarget visit based on the preceding history H<t. To\nprevent data leakage, patients reserved for the final\ndementia prognosis test set are strictly excluded\nfrom this phase.\n3.2\nStage 1: Cold-Start Pre-training\nIn this stage, we align the model to reason about\nclinical trajectories by optimizing it to predict the\nextracted scores st from Dpre. We utilize GRPO,\nwhich eliminates the need for a value function by\nestimating the baseline from a group of outputs.\nVerifiable Reward Function (Rcold)\nTo accom-\nmodate the varying granularity of clinical scales,\nwe define a tolerance-aware reward function. Let\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "ˆst be the predicted score from the output ot of the\nLLM, st be the ground truth, and δ be the allow-\nable error margin. Considering the range of the\nMMSE score (0–30), we set a tolerance of δ = 2,\ntreating predictions within this range as correct.\nFor coarser scales like GDS and CDR, we enforce\nexact matching by setting δ = 0. The reward is\ndefined as:\nRcold = I (|ˆst −st| ≤δ) ,\n(2)\nwhere I(·) is the indicator function that returns 1 if\nthe score is met and 0 otherwise.\nOptimization Objective\nFor each input query qt\nwith clinical history H<t, we sample a group of G\noutputs {o1\nt , o2\nt , . . . , oG\nt } from the old policy πθold.\nThe policy is optimized to maximize the following:\nL(θ) = Eqt,{oi\nt}\n\"\n1\nG\nG\nX\ni=1\nmin\n \nπθ(oi\nt|qt)\nπθold(oi\nt|qt)Ai,\nclip\n \nπθ(oi\nt|qt)\nπθold(oi\nt|qt), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ\n!\nAi\n!\n−βDKL\n#\n.\n(3)\nHere, βDKL controls the KL-regularization term,\nϵ is the clipping hyperparameter and Ai is the ad-\nvantage computed by group-based normalization:\nAi =\nRcold(oi\nt) −mean({Rcold(oj\nt)}G\nj=1)\nstd({Rcold(oj\nt)}G\nj=1)\n.\n(4)\nThis stabilizes training and encourages the model\nto generate reasoning paths that outperform the\naverage of its own samples.\n3.3\nStage 2: Task Fine-tuning\nAfter Cold-Start pre-training (Stage 1), we then\nfine-tune the model on the downstream prognostic\nclassification task (Dementia vs. Non-Dementia)\nusing the same GRPO framework in Eq. (3).\nSparse Reward Function (Rtask)\nUnlike the\ngranular scores in Stage 1, the final diagnosis is\nbinary. Therefore, the reward is defined as:\nRtask =\n(\n1,\nif prediction is correct\n0,\nif prediction is incorrect\n(5)\nAlthough this reward signal is sparse, the reasoning\ncapabilities acquired in Stage 1 allow the model to\nenhance the capability to reason about longitudi-\nnal disease progression. In this training stage, the\nmodel is optimized for the final prognostic accu-\nracy by generating reasoning traces.\n4\nExperimental Setup\n4.1\nDatasets\nWe validate the efficacy of Dementia-R1 on two\ndistinct cohorts: the real-world unstructured clin-\nical notes from Asan Medical Center (AMC) and\nthe structured Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) benchmark.\n4.1.1\nData Sources and Processing\nReal-World Unstructured Cohort (AMC).\nWe\nconstructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset us-\ning raw clinical notes from Asan Medical Cen-\nter (AMC). Clinical data were retrospectively col-\nlected from approximately 3,000 patients diag-\nnosed with neurocognitive disorders between Jan-\nuary 1, 2021, and September 30, 2023.\nInclu-\nsion criteria were based on ICD-10 codes covering\nAlzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and mild\ncognitive impairment. Electronic Medical Records\n(EMRs) covering initial and follow-up visits were\nreviewed to extract SOAP-formatted notes. To en-\nsure privacy, all personally identifiable information\nwas anonymized. Since the target clinical indices\n(MMSE, CDR, GDS) are predominantly embedded\nwithin the free-text “Objective” section, we utilized\nthe LLM-based extraction pipeline (described in\nSec 3.1) to isolate these values as verifiable re-\nwards.\nStructured Benchmark Cohort (ADNI).\nTo\ndemonstrate generalizability, we employed the\nADNI dataset (Jack Jr et al., 2008), a widely recog-\nnized benchmark for Alzheimer’s research. Unlike\nAMC, ADNI consists of structured tabular records.\nTo adapt this for our LLM-based framework, we ap-\nplied linearization, transforming tabular rows into\nchronological textual logs. For verifiable rewards,\nwe selected seven clinically significant indices (e.g.,\nMMSE, CDR-SB) via neurological consultation\nand feature analysis (Gelir et al., 2025), applying\nstandardized proportional tolerance thresholds (de-\ntails in Appendix A.3.2).\n4.1.2\nLongitudinal Sample Construction\nTo handle the fluctuating nature of cognitive de-\ncline across both modalities, we applied a unified\nconstruction protocol defined by three key compo-\nnents (illustrated in Figure 3):\n• Target Anchor: The patient’s last clinical\nvisit with a confirmed assessment.

To construct the training\ndataset, we prompted the teacher model to gener-\nate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales by reverse-\nengineering the ground-truth labels from the clini-\ncal notes. The student model was then fine-tuned\non these concatenated (Question, Patient Note,\nCoT, and Answer) sequences for three epochs with\na per-device batch size of 2.\nDementia-R1.\nWe train Dementia-R1 using\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with\na group size of G = 8 and an effective batch size\nof 8. Detailed training configurations and hardware\nspecifications are provided in Appendix A.8.\nEvaluation protocol.\nTo ensure statistical reli-\nability, we conducted all experiments across five\ndistinct random seeds.

Specifi-\ncally, Dementia-R1 outperforms the GRPO base-\nline (GRPO w/o Stage 1: 76.57%), indicating that\navoiding the sparse reward problem with verifiable\nclinical indices effectively contributes to perfor-\nmance improvement. Furthermore, our pipeline ex-\nceeds the standard hybrid approach (SFT →GRPO,\n75.85%), indicating that active exploration in RL-\nbased pre-training (Stage 1) facilitates more effec-\ntive modeling of symptom trajectories than super-\nvised fine-tuning.\nClinical index prediction.\nBeyond categorical\ndementia classification, we further evaluate the\nmodel’s reasoning capability through quantitative\nclinical index prediction on the AMC cohort. As\nshown in Table 3, Dementia-R1 achieves the high-\nest average accuracy (59.61%), surpassing the 7B\nbaselines. Notably, it outperforms the 32B model\non GDS and CDR–rigorous metrics used by neurol-\nogists for precise disease staging–while maintain-\ning competitive performance on the simpler MMSE\nscreening tool. This capability to infer fine-grained\nseverity demonstrates the model’s alignment with\nexpert clinical judgment.\n5.2\nGeneralization to Structured Benchmarks\nTo demonstrate the generalizability of our frame-\nwork across different data modalities, we applied\nthe Dementia-R1 methodology to the structured\nADNI benchmark. By training on linearized tab-\nular records as described in Sec 4.1.1, we verify\nwhether our reinforcement learning approach re-\nmains effective on structured data. Table 2 summa-\nrizes the performance. Dementia-R1 achieves an F1\nscore of 74.91%, demonstrating that our framework\nsuccessfully adapts to structured clinical logs. This\nperformance is comparable to substantially larger\nmodels such as GPT-4o (76.05%) and Qwen2.5-\n32B (73.86%).\nTo further probe fine-grained reasoning be-\nyond dementia-level classification, we visualize\nthe multi-dimensional performance in Figure 1.\nDespite having only 7B parameters, Dementia-R1\nmatches or closely approaches the best-performing\nmodels on CDRSB and ADAS scores (see Ap-\npendix Table 11). This confirms that our methodol-\nogy – reinforcement learning with verifiable clini-\ncal rewards – is not limited to unstructured text but\ngeneralizes effectively to structured data represen-\ntations.\n5.3\nNeurologist Evaluation\nTo validate the clinical utility and reasoning quality\nof Dementia-R1, we conducted a blinded human\nevaluation involving two board-certified neurolo-\ngists. We adopted a pairwise comparison protocol\non a subset of test cases to analyze the alignment of\nthe models’ internal logic with clinical standards.\nThe experts assessed responses across six dimen-\nsions: (1) Temporal Reasoning Accuracy, (2) Evi-\ndence Grounding, (3) Clinically Relevant Evidence\nSelection, (4) Medical Soundness, (5) Complete-\nness of Key Findings, and (6) Overall Clinical Util-\nity. For each comparison, evaluators selected the\nsuperior response (Win) or marked them as equal\n(Tie), restricted to cases where both models pro-\nvided the correct final prognosis. To assess the\nreliability of the human evaluation, we measured\ninter-rater agreement, resulting in a Cohen’s Kappa\nscore of 0.56, indicating moderate agreement.\nFor this comparative assessment, we selected\nQwen2.5-32B-Instruct as the baseline. Although\nsignificantly larger than our 7B backbone, this\nmodel demonstrated the second-best performance\nin the quantitative clinical index prediction task\n(Section 5.1), surpassing other 7B baselines. This\nselection enables a rigorous investigation into\nwhether our reasoning-aligned framework gener-\nates more clinically valid trajectories than simply\nscaling model parameters.\nAs shown in Figure 5, Dementia-R1 recorded a\n55% win rate in Overall Clinical Utility. Regard-\ning evidence usage, the model obtained 60% win\nrates in both Evidence Grounding and Clinically\nRelevant Evidence Selection. These results sug-\ngest that the proposed two-stage RL framework,\nwhich incorporates Cold-Start pre-training on clini-\ncal indices, enables more clinically grounded lon-\ngitudinal reasoning compared to parameter scaling\nalone. In terms of Temporal Reasoning Accuracy,\nthe model achieved a combined Win/Tie rate of\n95% (40% Win, 55% Tie) against the 32B base-\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Figure 5: Neurologist Blind Pairwise Evaluation.\nComparison between Dementia-R1 and the baseline\nmodel across six clinical dimensions.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nEpoch\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\nF1 Score\n(a) AMC Cohort\nDementia-R1 (Ours)\nGRPO w/o Stage 1\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nEpoch\n0.60\n0.65\n0.70\n0.75\n0.80\n(b) ADNI Cohort\nDementia-R1 (Ours)\nGRPO w/o Stage 1\nFigure 6: Training Dynamics.

A similar trend is observed on\nFigure 7: Performance across time gaps. Dementia-\nR1 demonstrates consistent stability, especially in long-\nterm predictions, compared to baselines.\nthe ADNI cohort. Specifically, based on F1 scores,\nDementia-R1 outperforms GPT-4o in the 18–24\nmonth interval (80.30% vs. 78.78%) and main-\ntains higher performance in the >24 month horizon\n(73.11% vs. 71.18%). These findings suggest that\naligning with longitudinal trajectories through ver-\nifiable rewards contributes to sustained reasoning\ncapabilities in long-term forecasting scenarios.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we presented Dementia-R1, a Rein-\nforcement Learning framework designed to infer\nlongitudinal disease progression from unstructured\nclinical narratives. Addressing the limitations of\nsparse rewards in prognostic tasks, we introduced\na Cold-Start RL strategy that aligns the model with\nverifiable clinical indices before fine-tuning for the\nfinal diagnosis. Empirical results on both the real-\nworld AMC cohort and the structured ADNI bench-\nmark demonstrate that our approach enables a 7B\nparameter model to achieve performance compa-\nrable to, or exceeding, that of significantly larger\nbaselines. Furthermore, qualitative evaluations by\nneurologists indicate that explicit training on in-\ntermediate clinical scores fosters more grounded\nand transparent reasoning trajectories. We hope\nthis work inspires further research into reinforce-\nment learning with verifiable rewards for complex,\nlong-horizon clinical decision-making.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Limitations\nWe acknowledge several limitations in our study.\n• First, regarding data generalization, our un-\nstructured dataset comes from a single institu-\ntion (Asan Medical Center). This may limit\nthe model’s ability to generalize to other de-\nmographics or documentation styles. Future\nvalidation on diverse, multi-center datasets is\nnecessary.\n• Second, linguistic limitations may arise from\nthe translation process. Converting Korean\nnotes into English might result in the loss of\nsubtle nuances, such as syntax errors, which\nare important for assessing cognitive decline.\nFuture work should apply our method directly\nto native-language texts.\n• Third, our framework relies on the perfor-\nmance of the auxiliary Large Language Mod-\nels (LLMs). We utilized the Qwen2.5 series\nfor data preprocessing, including the transla-\ntion of clinical notes and the extraction of clin-\nical scores. Consequently, our reward mecha-\nnism depends on the accuracy of these models;\nsince we use the extracted clinical scores as re-\nwards, any extraction errors or hallucinations\ncould introduce noise into the reinforcement\nlearning process.\n• Finally, our approach relies on quantifiable\nclinical indices (e.g., MMSE) for rewards.\nThis limits immediate application to diseases\nthat lack standardized numerical records. Ex-\ntending this framework to conditions with sub-\njective or qualitative markers remains a chal-\nlenge for future work.\nEthics Statement\nThis retrospective study was approved by the In-\nstitutional Review Board (IRB No. 2023-1628),\nwhich waived the requirement for informed con-\nsent due to the use of de-identified medical records.\nAll methods were performed in accordance with\nthe relevant guidelines and regulations of the Asan\nMedical Center Ethics Committee and the Decla-\nration of Helsinki.

Table 6 summarizes the\noverall dataset composition, and Table 7 reports\ntask-wise statistics.\nTo adapt distinct data modalities for our unified\nreasoning framework, we developed specialized\npreprocessing pipelines for both unstructured clin-\nical notes (Asan) and structured tabular records\n(ADNI). We applied a consistent protocol consist-\ning of Data Transformation followed by Dataset\nConstruction.\nA.3.1\nAsan Medical Center (Unstructured\nClinical Notes)\nData Transformation (Translation & Extrac-\ntion).\nWe transformed raw Korean clinical notes\ninto English reasoning contexts using a secure\npipeline. We utilized Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as an\nauxiliary LLM to translate notes and extract clin-\nical indices (MMSE, GDS, and CDR) to serve as\nverifiable ground truth targets. Crucially, all infer-\nence processes were conducted in a strictly isolated\non-premise environment to prevent any external\n11\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "data transmission.\nStage 1 Construction Pipeline.\nWe constructed\nthe pre-training dataset with the following criteria:\n1. Tolerance-Aware Labeling: We defined the\nprediction targets as extracted clinical indices.\nRecognizing extraction variability, we applied\na tolerance of ±2 for MMSE, treating predic-\ntions within this range as correct. Exact match-\ning was enforced for coarser scales (GDS,\nCDR).\n2. Token Filtering: Using the Qwen2.5 tok-\nenizer, we filtered out samples exceeding\n8,000 tokens to fit context constraints.\n3. Evaluation Set: The dataset was split into\ntraining and test sets at a patient level (80:20)\nto evaluate Stage 1 performance.\nA.3.2\nADNI Benchmark (Structured Tabular\nData)\nData\nTransformation\n(Linearization).\nWe\ntransformed\nstructured\ntabular\nrecords\ninto\nlongitudinal textual logs suitable for LLM input.\nFor each visit, we aggregated key biomark-\ners—including cognitive scores (MMSE, CDR-SB,\nADAS-Cog), CSF biomarkers (Aβ, Tau), and\nMRI measures—into a structured text block\n(e.g., “2011-05-12: «<VISIT 1»> CDRSB: 0.5,\nMMSE: 28...”). These blocks were concatenated\nchronologically to form the patient history.\nStage 1 Construction Pipeline.\nWe applied a\nconstruction protocol parallel to the Asan dataset\nbut adapted for the continuous nature of ADNI\nbiomarkers:\n1. Target Indices: We selected seven key indi-\ncators: MMSE, CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog (11, 13,\nQ4), RAVLT (Learning), and LDELTOTAL.\n2. Proportional Tolerance-Aware Labeling:\nUnlike categorical labels, these indices vary\nwidely in range. To standardize difficulty, we\ndefined a relative tolerance ratio ρ ≈6.7%\n(derived from the standard allowance of ±2\npoints on the 30-point MMSE scale). For each\nindex, the allowable error margin δ was calcu-\nlated as ⌈Range × ρ⌉. The specific thresholds\nare detailed in Table 8.\n3. Token Filtering: Samples exceeding 8,000\ntokens were filtered out using the tokenizer\nconstraints.\n4. Evaluation Set: Consistent with the Asan\nprotocol, we applied a stratified patient-level\nsplit (80:20). Due to the high computational\ncost of longitudinal reasoning, the final evalu-\nation was conducted on a stratified 50% sub-\nsample of the test set.\nTable 8: Tolerance Thresholds for ADNI Indices.

Figure 8 de-\ntails the distribution of these time gaps for the test\nsets. Notably, the ADNI cohort (right) presents a\nsignificantly more challenging scenario, with ap-\nproximately half (∼50%) of the samples having a\ngap exceeding 24 months, including a long tail ex-\ntending beyond 36 months. This contrasts sharply\nwith the Asan cohort, which is predominantly con-\ncentrated in the short-term range (6–12 months).\nThis diversity ensures that our evaluation covers\nboth immediate screening and long-term prognos-\ntic scenarios.\nFigure 8: Time Gap Distribution by Cohort (Test\nSets). The histograms show the interval between the\nlast available clinical note and the diagnosis date. The\nAsan cohort is concentrated in shorter intervals (6–18m),\nreflecting relatively dense clinical follow-up prior to\ndiagnosis. In contrast, the ADNI cohort displays a sub-\nstantially wider temporal range, extending beyond 36\nmonths, which reflects the longitudinal nature of MCI\nprogression monitoring.\n12\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "A.5\nStage 1: Performance of Intermediate\nClinical Indices\nWe analyze the model’s capability to predict inter-\nmediate clinical indices. On the structured ADNI\nbenchmark (Tables 10, 11), Dementia-R1 demon-\nstrates superior performance in long-term forecast-\ning (>18 months), particularly on the critical CDR-\nSB metric. Similarly, on the unstructured Asan co-\nhort (Tables 9), the model consistently outperforms\nbaselines in short-to-mid term intervals, achieving\nnotable gains in GDS and CDR prediction.\nA.6\nStage 2: Performance of Final Binary\nPrognosis\nBuilding on the clinical indicators established in\nStage 1, Stage 2 assesses the model’s ultimate ca-\npacity to determine the final binary prognosis. As\nsummarized in Table 12, Dementia-R1 achieves\nthe highest overall F1-score on the Asan dataset,\ndemonstrating notable consistency across the term\nintervals. Notably, it maintains competitive perfor-\nmance in both short-term (6–12m) and long-term\n(18–24m) intervals, proving its stability across dif-\nferent forecasting ranges. Similarly, the results on\nthe ADNI benchmark (Table 13) further highlight\nthe model’s enhanced robustness in long-term fore-\ncasting (> 18 months). In these extended horizons,\nDementia-R1 not only surpasses proprietary fron-\ntier models such as GPT-4o but also outperforms\nlarger specialized baselines, effectively validating\nconfirming its effectiveness in modeling longitudi-\nnal disease trajectories.\nA.7\nQualitative Analysis: Comparative\nReasoning\nTo demonstrate the impact of our proposed method\non reasoning quality, we compare the outputs of\nDementia-R1 against the Qwen2.5-32B model us-\ning a representative longitudinal case from the\nAMC cohort. Figure 9 illustrates the input clin-\nical note, which follows a semi-structured SOAP\nformat. In this record, critical signals such as cogni-\ntive scores (MMSE, GDS) and medication changes\nare embedded within the free-text Objective and\nPlan sections across multiple visits spanning from\n2020 to 2023. This presents a complex reasoning\nchallenge, requiring the model to aggregate scat-\ntered clinical indicators and correctly reconstruct\nthe patient’s disease trajectory from the unstruc-\ntured narrative.\nWhile both models correctly predict the final\ndiagnosis, their reasoning processes diverge signif-\nicantly. Figure 10 presents the reasoning outputs\ngenerated by both models. Dementia-R1 effec-\ntively structures the longitudinal information by\norganizing the output into distinct sections for cog-\nnitive assessment history, diagnosis, and current\nstatus. This structural clarity allows clinicians to\nrapidly verify the evidence. Notably, the model\naccurately reconstructs the temporal trajectory of\ncognitive decline and correctly identifies the drop\nin MMSE scores from 23 down to 17 alongside the\nplateau in the most recent visits. Furthermore, it\ncorrectly identifies the medication switch involving\nthe discontinuation of Bearcept and the addition\nof Ebixa, demonstrating precise grounding in the\nclinical text.\nIn contrast, despite arriving at the correct label,\nQwen2.5-32B produces a dense, unstructured block\nof text that is difficult to audit for clinical decision-\nmaking. More critically, it exhibits significant fail-\nures in medical soundness and domain knowledge.\nFirst, the baseline hallucinates a pharmacologi-\ncal equivalence by describing \"Ebixa (donepezil)\"\neven though Ebixa is memantine, an NMDA re-\nceptor antagonist distinct from the cholinesterase\ninhibitor donepezil. Such hallucinations pose po-\ntential safety risks in clinical settings. Second,\nthe baseline misinterprets the Global Deterioration\nScale (GDS) scores of 3-4 as indicators of \"mild de-\npression\" and confuses the dementia staging scale\nwith a depression inventory. These findings un-\nderscore that general-purpose reasoning capabili-\nties, even in larger models, do not automatically\ntranslate to clinical accuracy. Our results demon-\nstrate that the domain-specific alignment integrated\ninto Dementia-R1 is essential for correcting such\nmisconceptions and ensuring the high reliability\nrequired for longitudinal dementia prognosis.\nA.8\nTraining Implementation Details\nWe implemented our framework using PyTorch.\nAll experiments were conducted on four NVIDIA\nH100 (80GB) GPUs.\nReinforcement Learning (Dementia-R1)\nFor\nthe RL stage, we utilized the Open-R1 frame-\nwork.\nWe employed DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 and\nvLLM (colocate mode) to optimize memory usage\nfor processing long clinical narratives.

Here’s\nthe step-by-step reasoning:\n1. **Cognitive Assessments Over Time:**\n- 2020/08/27: MMSE 23, GDS 4 (Severe cognitive decline)\n- 2022/02/03: MMSE 21, GDS 3 (Moderate cognitive decline)\n- 2022/09/01: MMSE 17, GDS 4 (Severe cognitive decline)\n- 2023/08/30: MMSE 17 (recall 2), GDS 4 (Severe cognitive decline)\n2. **Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR):**\n- The CDR scores are consistently 0.5 or 1, indicating very mild to mild dementia.\n3. **Symptoms and Functional Decline:**\n- The patient reports forgetfulness, sometimes forgetting what they went for when crossing the room.\n- Caregiver observes a slight decline.\n- The patient handles all household chores personally but shows signs of memory impairment.\n4. **Diagnosis and Plan:**\n- The patient is diagnosed with VaD (Vascular Dementia) and MTA2/3 D3P3.\n- The patient is currently in an amnestic mild cognitive impairment state, with a retrieval deficit in verbal and visual\nmemory.\n- The patient has shown cognitive decline since around 2019, which has gradually worsened.\n5. **Current Status:**\n- The most recent MMSE score (17) and GDS score (4) indicate severe cognitive decline.\n- The patient’s CDR score is 0.5 or 1, indicating very mild to mild dementia.\n- The patient’s condition has not improved over the past year, and the decline is consistent with a diagnosis of dementia.\nGiven the consistent cognitive decline, severe MMSE and GDS scores, and the diagnosis of VaD, it is clear\nthat the patient is likely to have dementia.\n[QWEN 2.5 32B output]\n1. The patient’s MMSE scores have been declining over time: 23 in 2020, 21 in 2022, and 17 in 2022 and 2023. A score\nof 17 is indicative of mild to moderate cognitive impairment.\n2. The patient has been diagnosed with major neurocognitive disorder, specifically vascular dementia (VaD), and is\nclassified as MTA2/3 D3P3.\n3. The caregiver observes a slight decline in the patient’s cognitive function, and the patient sometimes forgets what\nthey went for when crossing the room, which is a sign of cognitive impairment.\n4. The patient’s GDS score has been consistently around 3-4, indicating mild depression, which can be associated with\ncognitive decline.\n5. The patient’s cognitive test results suggest a retrieval deficit in verbal memory and a deficit in visual memory, with\nother cognitive functions within normal levels.\n6. The patient is in an amnestic mild cognitive impairment state, with cognitive decline since around 2019, which has\ngradually worsened.\n7. The patient has multiple vascular risk factors, and the test results indicate a retrieval deficit, suggesting subcortical\nvascular cognitive impairment.\n8. The patient’s advanced age and more pronounced memory impairment compared to other cognitive domains suggest\nAlzheimer’s disease underlying pathology or a combined condition.\n9. The patient is being treated with Ebixa (donepezil), which is commonly used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease\nand other forms of dementia\nFigure 10: A comparison of the reasoning processes generated by Dementia-R1 and the Qwen2.5-32B for the\nclinical case shown in Figure 9.
