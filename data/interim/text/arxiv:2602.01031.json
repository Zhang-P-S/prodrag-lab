Average hallucination rate on HALLUHARD that contains\n950 multi-turn conversations across legal, research, medical, and\ncoding domains. WS denotes web search. Lower values are better.\nOur challenging benchmark reveals that even frontier LLMs like\nOpus-4.5 hallucinate in more than 30% of cases with web search\nand 60% without.\nfailure mode commonly referred to as hallucination. Such\nerrors are difficult for users to detect and can meaningfully\nerode trust in LLM-assisted workflows.\nTo properly understand and mitigate hallucination, evalu-\nating hallucination is fundamental. Many existing bench-\nmarks saturate quickly as models improve. Yet many exist-\ning benchmarks saturate as models improve, in part because\nthey target relatively easy domains or constrained formats\nsuch as short-form QA or classification, and because they\nrely on simplified single-turn prompts that diverge from real-\nworld use. In practice, LLMs operate in multi-turn, open-\nended conversations where context evolves, references ac-\ncumulate, and early inaccuracies can propagate. To address\nthis gap, we introduce HALLUHARD, a new benchmark de-\nsigned to evaluate hallucinations in multi-turn interactions\nand in more challenging task settings.\nHALLUHARD mirrors real-world, open-ended interactions\nwith LLMs while still supporting verifiable hallucination\nevaluation. During generation, models are instructed to\nsupport factual claims with explicit citations, providing a\nconcrete anchor for verification. Our web-search-based\njudge then follows these citations to retrieve and read the\nreferenced sources in full text, including parsing PDFs when\nneeded. This setup exposes a subtle yet common failure\nmode that is often overlooked: a model may cite an appro-\npriate source but still fabricate details that the source does\nnot substantiate, as illustrated in Figure 2. Without reading\nthe full paper, such hallucinations are easy to miss.\n1\narXiv:2602.01031v1  [cs.AI]  1 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\nFigure 2. An example of a hallucinated claim from our judge. A\nclaim is classified as hallucination if either reference or content\ngrounding failure happens.\nWe curate questions spanning four challenging domains\nwhere niche information (”niche” refers to information that\nis rarely present in the data) is both prevalent and high-\nstakes. By benchmarking hallucination behavior in frontier\nmodels, we surface several dimensions along which errors\ndiffer. We find that model capacity, turn position, reasoning\neffort, and data type all significantly affect hallucination\nrates. Contrary to the common belief that web-search in-\ntegration can resolve hallucinations, our results show that\ncontent grounding remains challenging even for frontier\nproprietary models.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose a hard multi-turn hallucination benchmark\nHALLUHARD, which contains 950 seed questions\nspanning 4 challenging task domains. Even for Claude-\nOpus-4.5 and GPT-5.2-thinking with web search tool,\nthe hallucination rate remains high (∼30%).\n• We propose a reliable, citation-checkable LLM judge\npipeline that performs claim extraction, plans evidence\nretrieval, fetches full-text sources (including PDF re-\ntrieval/parsing for content-grounding verification), and\nproduces structured reference- vs content-grounding\nverdicts with a fallback for hard cases.\n• We provide a comprehensive empirical study across\nfrontier proprietary and open-weight models and iden-\ntify key drivers of hallucinations in multi-turn settings.\nIn particular, hallucinations rise in later turns due to\nerror propagation; enabling effective thinking reduces\nhallucinations, but additional reasoning effort does not\nnecessarily yield further gains; and content grounding\nremains challenging even with web search enabled.\n2. Related Work\nHallucination is often categorized as two types. One is in-\ncontext hallucination, which evaluates whether a model’s\nresponse is grounded in the provided context. This notion\nis central in summarization and other grounding-sensitive\ntasks (Kryscinski et al., 2020; He et al., 2025; Bao et al.,\n2025). We argue, however, that this criterion is tightly en-\ntangled with instruction-following ability, i.e., whether the\nmodel can restrict itself to using only the given context when\nprompted to do so (McMillan et al., 2025), and therefore\nmay not cleanly measure hallucination propensity.\nThe other category is in-parameter hallucination, which\nasks whether an LLM’s outputs are consistent with informa-\ntion encoded in its parameters. World knowledge is often\ntreated as a proxy of in-parameter knowledge gained from\nweb-scale data (Weng, 2024). In-parameter hallucination\nis commonly evaluated using short-form factual prompts\n(e.g., QA-style queries) (Lin et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2024a;\nAgrawal et al., 2024; Pandit et al., 2025), and also via long-\nform generation where responses are broken into atomic\nfacts that can be verified one by one (Min et al., 2023a;\nManakul et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024b). Beyond answer-\nable questions, a clean test of in-parameter groundedness\nis whether models appropriately abstain when asked about\nnon-existent entities or items (Bang et al., 2025; Kirichenko\net al., 2025). While the above focus on a single-turn setting,\na few works also involve a more challenging multi-turn sce-\nnario. Some quantify hallucination by testing whether mod-\nels can detect hallucinated content in dialogues annotated by\nhumans (Chen et al., 2024; 2025). More recently, KnowMT-\nBench (Anonymous, 2025) evaluates multi-turn responses\nby checking for contradictions against a gold answer or\nrequired ”must-have” facts. However, these benchmarks\nlargely avoid open-ended generation for easy hallucination\nverification, despite this being the dominant way users in-\nteract with LLMs today. We address this gap by evaluating\nhallucinations in open-ended, multi-turn responses in a veri-\nfiable manner.\nEvaluating hallucinations makes it possible to systemat-\nically characterize how LLMs hallucinate. As evidence\naccumulates, it becomes possible to develop empirical un-\nderstanding of recurring hallucinatory patterns. Lin et al.\n(2024) show that fine-tuning LLMs on human-labeled data\ncan reduce factuality as models encounter with novel knowl-\nedge or unfamiliar texts. Song et al. (2025) warn that rein-\nforcement fine-tuning can make LLMs less likely to refuse\nunanswerable questions. Ravichander et al. (2025) find that\nlarger models generally hallucinate less than smaller ones on\nresponse-based tasks, but this advantage does not necessar-\nily extend to refusal-based tasks. Still, because these results\nreflect only a limited set of frontier models and evaluation\nsettings, they do not yet yield a comprehensive account of\nhallucination behavior. Here, we offer a more careful and\nthorough investigation.\n3. Why a New Benchmark?\nUnclear definition. We define hallucination purely in terms\nof groundedness: an output is hallucinated if it is not sup-\nported by either in-parameter knowledge or the in-context\ndocuments. This notion should be separated from other fail-\nure modes, including retrieval errors (e.g., a RAG system\nretrieves irrelevant documents), biases in training data (e.g.,\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\nstale or skewed information), and reasoning errors (common\nin math; e.g., 1+1=3 reflects faulty reasoning rather than\nhallucination). These phenomena correspond to different\nunderlying capabilities of LLMs and should be evaluated\ndistinctly.\nThis definition aligns with HalluLens (Bang et al., 2025).\nHowever, the criterion ”inconsistent with training data” is\ndifficult to operationalize in practice. HalluLens addresses\nit by constructing tasks from Wikipedia articles, implicitly\nassuming that Wikipedia content is included in the training\nmixture of most frontier models. Yet in long-form, open-\nended generation, even for prompts derived from Wikipedia,\nmodels may rely on parametric knowledge acquired from\nother sources. Therefore, inconsistency with a Wikipedia\narticle does not necessarily imply inconsistency with the\nmodel’s training data.\nTo more directly assess whether outputs are grounded in\ntraining data, we require models to provide verbatim source\nquotations. When a cited source is retrievable and the quoted\npassage can be verified, we treat it as evidence that the\nmodel is drawing from that document, enabling reliable\ngroundedness evaluation. Conversely, if the cited source\ncannot be located, we treat this as a mis-attributed reference,\nan unambiguous instance of reference hallucination.\nSaturated past benchmarks. Many factuality evaluations\nare single-turn with a single, indisputable short answer,\nwhich makes them easy to ”solve” with retrieval. For ex-\nample, GPT-4o Search Preview reaches 90% accuracy on\nSimpleQA, and GPT-5-thinking with web search can reach\n95.1% accuracy. Given that SimpleQA’s estimated bench-\nmark error rate is about 3% (Wei et al., 2024a), performance\nwith web search is already near the ceiling, suggesting the\nbenchmark is largely saturated under a browsing setting.\nLong-form factuality benchmarks are often anchored to well-\ncurated topics that are typically extensively documented on\nthe web. Even without web browsing tools, the hallucination\nrate of LongFact can get down to around 1% with GPT-5\nfamily (OpenAI, 2025a). Empirical studies find higher hallu-\ncination rates when entities lack Wikipedia pages or require\nbroader web evidence (Zhao et al., 2024). To meaningfully\ntrack hallucination behavior as LLMs rapidly improve, we\nneed benchmarks that remain difficult under tool use, e.g.,\nby emphasizing niche entities, multi-step synthesis rather\nthan single-turn fact retrieval.\nLimited judge capability. For the hallucination evaluation\nin open-ended generation, extracting and verifying atomic\nclaims has become the standard way (Min et al., 2023b;\nWei et al., 2024b). Most works continue to use Search-\nAugmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE) from LongFact.\nSAFE works as follows: 1) it extracts self-contained atomic\nfactual claims from a response; 2) for each claim, it uses a\nmodel to generate a search query based on the claim to rate,\nand the search results that have previously been obtained.\nThe search query is then fed to Serper API, which retrieves\nrelevant snippets from Google Search. After five such steps,\nthe model performs reasoning to determine whether the fact\nis supported by the search results. This approach works well\nfor easy facts that are presented in an encyclopedia or other\nscholarly sources.\nHowever, we notice that Serper API returns only snippets\nand related metadata of a webpage, not the full text of a\nwebsite. The retrieved snippets can be insufficient to judge\nclaims that require broader context, longer quotations, or\nevidence buried deeper in the page (e.g., in tables, figures,\nfootnotes, or sections not captured by the snippet). As a\nresult, SAFE may incorrectly mark a true claim as unsup-\nported simply because the relevant supporting passage is\nnot surfaced, or conversely accept a false claim if a snippet\ncontains ambiguous phrasing that appears to corroborate\nit. This limitation is amplified for niche or highly techni-\ncal statements whose validation depends on careful detail\nretrieval or precise definitions, rather than a single sentence-\nlevel match.\n4. Our Benchmark: HALLUHARD\nHALLUHARD is distinguished by its multi-turn design, the\ninclusion of a verifiable LLM judge, and broad coverage of\nhigh-stakes domains.\n4.1. Selection of high-stakes domains\nWe cover four domains: legal cases, research questions,\nmedical guidelines, and coding. For each domain, we de-\nscribe the generation of seed questions, following which\nmulti-turn interaction starts. For the first three domains, we\ngenerate 250 seed questions each, and 200 for coding. All\ngenerated seed questions are reviewed by domain experts.\nLegal cases. We take existing verified legal questions from\nMagesh et al. (2025), selecting the following four question\ntypes: SCALR, Rule QA, Changes in Law and Bar Exam,\nas they incentivize open-ended answers. To make a 250-\nquestion set, we additionally prompt an LLM to generate 50\ncomparable questions from past bar exams from The State\nBar of California (2025). These generated questions are\nsubsequently reviewed and validated by a law student.\nResearch questions. We create research questions from\nabstracts of ArXiv articles. To make sure that the articles are\nseen by the models (within their knowledge cutoff date), we\nonly select articles that are published up to 2023. We base\nour research questions on half niche papers (between 5 and\n30 citations) and half known papers (with more than 1000\ncitations). The questions are generated using GPT-5-mini\nmodel.\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\nFigure 3. Our multi-turn response generation pipeline. Seed\nqueries are provided by HALLUHARD, and follow-up queries\nare generated via a user LLM.\nMedical guidelines. To make sure the claims are citation-\nverifiable, we limit ourselves to existing medical guidelines,\nsuch as NICE1. We download available guidelines from\nonline PDF links and parse them into text files. We then\nselect guidelines that are publicly available prior to 2023,\nand use GPT-5-mini to craft open-ended written-exam-like\nquestions from selected guideline articles.\nCoding. We follow the same question construction as in Kr-\nishna et al. (2025), and choose four programming languages:\nPython, Scala, R, and Elixir. Unlike the other 3 do-\nmains, citing support sources is less likely. Instead, we\ncheck the following three different types of hallucinations:\n• Installation hallucination.\nInstallation command\non packages/libraries that do not exist, including\nfabricated names, non-existent versions, etc.\nFor\nexample, pip install pandas-pro==9.4.1\nwhere pandas-pro is fabricated, or apt-get\ninstall python3-anthropic-cli\nwhere\nclaims a non-existent OS package with the exact name.\n• Package importing hallucination. Import non-existent\npackages or import non-existent functions from a\npackage.\nFor example, from numpy import\ndataframe, where dataframe is not a NumPy ex-\nport, or import torchlite where torchlite\nis fabricated.\n• Function calling hallucination.\nCalling a non-\nexistent function from a package or inventing\narguments for an existent function.\nFor exam-\nple,\npandas.read jsonl(\"data.jsonl\")\nwhere pandas doesn’t have read jsonl,\nor\nimport json; obj = json.loads(s,\nignore comments=True) where json.loads\ndoesn’t accept ignore comments.\n4.2. Multi-turn design\nTo simulate multi-turn dialogue, we introduce a user LLM\nthat reviews the previous conversation history and proposes\n1https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance\nFigure 4. Our claim-based verification pipeline. For each claim,\nwe check whether the reference is correct and whether the claimed\ncontent is grounded in that reference.\na natural, engaging follow-up question grounded in the con-\nversation history. For each subsequent assistant turn, we\nprovide the target LLM with the entire dialogue to date plus\nthe newly generated question as context. The diagram is il-\nlustrated in Figure 3. For both the initial (seed) question and\nevery user LLM-generated follow-up question, we append\nan explicit instruction requiring the model to include inline\ncitations that support its factual claims.\n4.3. Our judge system\nWe use two separate evaluation pipelines depending on the\ntask domain. For legal cases, research questions, and med-\nical guidelines, responses can be decomposed into atomic\nclaims, so we verify them individually. For coding tasks,\nwhere citations are typically unavailable, we evaluate the\nresponse as a whole rather than claim by claim.\n4.3.1. CLAIM-BASED VERIFICATION\nAs done by Wei et al. (2024b), we use web search to verify\neach extracted atomic claim. Our proposed judge pipeline\nis a modular, stage-wise system that converts assistant out-\nputs into checkable claims, retrieves supporting evidence\nusing Serper API, and produces structured hallucination\njudgments. Relative to SAFE, our judge offers two key\nadvantages: (1) it can fetch full-text content from cited\nsources; and (2) rather than issuing a fixed, pre-set number\nof Serper calls, it uses an LLM to decide when the current\nevidence is sufficient. When it is, the pipeline stops; when\nit is not, the LLM refines the query and triggers additional\nsearches to gather more relevant evidence. The detailed\njudging pipeline is detailed as follows:\n1. Claim extraction. From a multi-turn conversation,\nwe use an LLM-based extractor to identify verifiable\natomic claims in the assistant’s responses. We ensure\nthat each claim extracted includes both an existing\nreference and existing supported content.\n2. Evidence retrieval planning and search.

The LLM planner decides if\nthe collected evidence is enough to verify the claim. At\nmost, 5 steps of Serper retrieval can be done. Within\neach step, the module selects a small set of target\nsources for downstream fetching (as full text is needed\nsometimes to check content grounding), typically up\nto 2 HTML pages and 1 PDF.\n3.

Claims with insufficient retrievable evidence\nare flagged for alternative handling.\n4. Judgment and verdict generation.

For Gemini, web search is implemented via Vertex\nAI Search; however, the returned links cannot be opened by\nour judge, so we omit the web-enabled setting. For open-\nweight models, web search is not natively supported in the\nAPIs, and we therefore do not evaluate search-augmented\nvariants. Additional implementation details are provided in\nAppendix A. Overall, we find that hallucination rates are\nlargely stable across temperature settings.\nFor each model configuration and task domain, we gener-\nate two follow-up questions, yielding 3 turns per conversa-\ntion. Unless otherwise noted, the hallucination rate (H%)\nis computed as the average across all 3 turns. To control\nevaluation cost, we sample a subset of 100 seed questions\nin the legal cases, research questions, and medical guide-\nlines domains. From each response, we sample 5 claims,\nresulting in at most 100 × 3 × 5 = 1500 claims for judg-\nment (For some turns, there could be less than 5 claims in\ntotal). This claim volume provides a reliable and statisti-\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\ncally meaningful estimate. For the coding domain, as the\nhallucination is measured at the response level, we evaluate\nall 200 conversations, making it 200 × 3 = 600 responses\nin total.\nAtomic-claim benchmarks typically report both accuracy\n(precision) and recall, since accuracy alone can be inflated\nwhen a model produces fewer, less informative claims. Our\nclaim-sampling strategy mitigates this: by randomly sam-\npling a fixed number of claims from each response, we keep\nevaluations comparable across models and obtain a more\nreliable accuracy estimate. The resulting average hallucina-\ntion rates are summarized in Table 3.\n5.2. What matters for LLM hallucinations?\nModels hallucinate more in later turns? We have noticed\nthat the hallucination rate of LLMs goes up with more con-\nversation turns for tasks that require citation grounding, as\nshown in Figure 6. This is because models always see the\nfull conversation history when generating each response.\nWe argue that the model starts conditioning on its own ear-\nlier mistakes, as we often see the same erroneous citations\nacross turns. We summarize the percentage of incorrect\nreferences repeated in later turns in Table 9: 3-20% of in-\ncorrect references in the first turn reappear in later runs.\nThis phenomenon is also cautioned by Sinha et al. (2025)\nas self-conditioning effect.\nHowever, we notice that for coding domain, the turn-wise\nhallcucination rate has a downward trend (Figure 9). From\nour investigation, we observe that the task often narrows\nover time. Our coding threads start broad (”build X”), then\nbecome focused (”fix this function”, ”handle this edge case”,\n”why is this query slow”). The narrower problems leave less\nroom for creative-but-wrong codes.\nMore capable models hallucinate less. As model size in-\ncreases, from GPT-5-nano to GPT-5-mini to the standard\nGPT-5 model, we observe a consistent reduction in hallu-\ncination rates across all domains. Within the same lineage,\nthe newer flagship model GPT-5.2 shows a substantial im-\nprovement over its predecessor GPT-5. Similarly, this is\nalso observed across Claude-4.5-Haiku, Sonnet and Opus,\nwhere the most capable Opus model hallucinates the least.\nDoes thinking help with hallucination mitigation? Ta-\nble 4 summarizes hallucination rates across models under\nvarying reasoning-effort settings. We observe a clear sep-\naration between reasoning and non-reasoning models. We\nprovide evidence in the coding domain as well in Figure 7,\nwhere reasoning largely reduces hallucination in all cod-\ning languages and types, apart from Python. However, for\nreasoning models, increasing reasoning effort does not con-\nsistently translate into lower hallucination rates. Models\nwith stronger reasoning tend to produce longer, more de-\ntailed responses (reflected in higher counts of unique ref-\nTurn 1\nTurn 2\nTurn 3\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nHallucination rate\nGPT-5-mini\nGPT-5\nGPT-5-thinking\nGPT-5.2\nDeepSeek-Chat\nDeepSeek-Reasoner\nClaude-Haiku-4.5\nClaude-Sonnet-4.5\nClaude-Opus-4.5\nGemini-3-Flash\nGemini-3-Pro\nFigure 6.

Notably, improved reasoning capability\nalone is not sufficient to mitigate hallucinations: for ex-\nample, DeepSeek-Reasoner and DeepSeek-Chat exhibit no\nmeaningful difference in hallucination behavior. Taken to-\ngether, these patterns also point to a persistent reasoning gap\nbetween proprietary models and open-source alternatives.\nContent grounding remains a major challenge even with\nweb search. Across all model configurations and task do-\nmains, content-grounding failures are far more common\nthan reference failures. Within the coding domain, function-\ncall hallucinations outnumber import or installation hallu-\ncinations. We hypothesize that this disparity reflects data\navailability: function names and paper titles are frequently\nrepeated online, whereas detailed function behavior and fine-\ngrained paper content typically appear only in full source\ntexts, making them less prevalent in web-scale corpora.\nTable 4.

When Models Abstain vs Hallucinate?\nHALLUHARD shows high hallucination rates. Yet, it is\nunclear whether it is because models fabricate information\nor because niche knowledge is difficult to answer precisely.\nMoreover, we want to understand if there is indeed a domain\ndependency in hallucinatory behaviors. To explore this, we\ndesign a short QA-style controlled experiment that probes\nmodel behavior across multiple domains and data types.\nWe consider the following five domains: Arts, Geography,\nHistory, Research, and Science. For Geography, History,\nand Science, we curate questions targeting extremely ob-\nscure or fabricated facts. In Arts and Research, we ask\nabout specific artworks and research papers, allowing us to\nquantify how prevalent the underlying knowledge is. We\nconsider two conditions: (i) fabricated items, consisting of\nentirely fictitious artworks or fabricated paper titles, and (ii)\nniche items, comprising artworks exhibited in local galleries\nby lesser-known artists and research papers with fewer than\n50 citations. For both fabricated and niche items, we use\nthe same question templates (Appendix C.4), ensuring that\nknowledge type is the only factor that varies. For each cate-\ngory, we generate 50 questions, and in total 350 questions\nare collected. Example questions are shown in Table 10.\nLLMs struggle with niche facts, not fabricated ones. Fig-\nure 8 summarizes the outcomes. Hallucinatory behavior\ndoes not seem to be domain-dependent. We are however,\nable to observe a pronounced gap between the niche and\nfabricated settings in both arts and research domains: mod-\nels tend to struggle with niche queries, yet are more likely\nto abstain when faced with completely fabricated items.

That puts the model in\na dangerous middle zone: it is incentivized to guess, as there\nare non-zero chances of getting it correct (Kalai et al., 2025).\nBang et al. (2025) had a similar observation by investigating\nthe model’s abstention behavior across mixed or completely\nfabricated entities, and found that the model has sufficient\nknowledge to identify non-existing entities.\nReasoning and abstention. Compared to long open-ended\ngeneration, the short-form QA task elicits substantially more\nabstention. While Kirichenko et al. (2025) report that adding\nreasoning reduces abstention, our results suggest that the\neffect of reasoning is model-dependent. In particular, we\nobserve opposite trends in the DeepSeek and GPT families:\nGPT-5.2-thinking abstains significantly more than GPT-5.2,\nespecially in terms of niche knowledge. We hypothesize that\nmore effective thinking increases awareness of the model’s\nknowledge boundary, leading it to abstain rather than specu-\nlate when evidence is sparse.\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce the first hallucination bench-\nmark designed for multi-turn, open-ended generation – HAL-\nLUHARD. Through evaluation, we uncover several insights:\nMore capable models tend to hallucinate less; models can\nbecome progressively more prone to hallucination across\nturns due to error propagation, and effective thinking can\nreduce hallucinations, but additional reasoning effort does\nnot necessarily yield further gains.\nOur evaluation highlights two settings in which hallucina-\ntions are most prevalent: (1) when models are asked about\nniche facts, and (2) when models try to produce detailed\nand in-depth claims while citing sources. The second failure\nmode appears more tractable: it can be mitigated with more\ntest-time compute and stronger web-enabled verification, in-\ncluding faithful retrieval and reading of the underlying doc-\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\numents. The first remains intrinsically difficult because new,\nniche facts continually emerge. These results underscore the\nneed for LLMs to have better awareness of uncertainty and\nto rely on web search verification when answering questions\ninvolving niche knowledge.\nAcknowledgement.

Model List\nDetails for all models evaluated in this manuscript are provided in Table 6. Note that what counts as ”niche knowledge”\ndepends on the model’s training data and its knowledge cutoff, so the designation is inherently relative.\nFor most models, we set the temperature to 0.0 to minimize sampling variability. For the GPT family, temperature is not\nconfigurable, so we use the default setting. For Gemini models, we likewise use the default temperature of 1.0, consistent\nwith the official guidance: ”For Gemini 3, we strongly recommend keeping the temperature parameter at its default value\nof 1.0. Gemini 3’s reasoning capabilities are optimized for the default setting. Changing the temperature (setting it below\n1.0) may lead to unexpected behavior, such as looping or degraded performance, particularly in complex mathematical or\nreasoning tasks.”\nAlthough temperature can influence hallucination behavior, Omar et al. (2025) report that setting temperature to zero does\nnot significantly reduce hallucinations. We additionally tested the influence of temperature and reported the results in\nTable 7. The influence of sampling temperature on hallucination behavior is negligible. We therefore interpret our results as\nprimarily reflecting differences in models’ grounding and verification capabilities.\nTable 6.

The quality of our judge\nD.1. Research questions\nWe ask two human annotators to independently extract all claims from 10 selected responses and to determine whether each\nclaim is hallucinated, considering both reference grounding and content grounding. These annotations serve as the gold\nstandard against which we evaluate our judge.\nClaim extraction evaluation.\nCompared to human judges, our automatic judge extracts more atomic claims. We manually\nchecked the disagreements in extractions, and find that our extractor even made fewer mistakes than the human extractors.\nWe summarize the results in Table 11.\nTable 11. Comparison between human and automatic claim extraction.\nCategory\nCount\nDescription\nClaims missed by both humans but ex-\ntracted by the extractor\n3\nValid claims overlooked by both annotators\nClaims missed by one human but extracted\nby the extractor\n4\nValid claims identified by the extractor and\none annotator\nClaims extracted by the extractor but should\nnot have been extracted\n1\nFalse positive\nClaims extracted by humans but missed by\nthe extractor\n0\nNo claims were missed by the extractor\nTotal claims extracted by the extractor\n128\n–\nTotal claims extracted by both humans\n120\nIntersection of human extractions\nEvaluation Quality.\nFor the set of commonly extracted claims, we compare our judge with human judges on claim-wise\njudgements in Table 2. The two human evaluators show the highest agreement in content-grounding verification, and our\n21\n"}, {"page": 22, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\njudge achieves the next-highest agreement, outperforming the OpenAI web-search judge and SAFE. With approximately\n88% agreement between the human annotators and our judge, we conclude that the automatic judge is reliable.\nEven human annotators do not achieve perfect agreement on reference grounding. A small portion of reference disagreements\nis attributable to lapses in bibliographic verification (e.g., failing to check a particular metadata field), where one annotator\nconfirms a detail that the other overlooks. Most remaining reference disagreements are driven by ambiguous citations,\nespecially those specified only by author and year. In these cases, one annotator may select a plausible match, while the\nother concludes that the retrieved work does not meaningfully address the stated topic, resulting in a mismatched entry.\nNotably, for such ambiguous references, both annotators consistently agree that the claim is not content grounded. For\ncontent grounding, the primary source of disagreement reflects a stricter vs. looser standard for what counts as grounded:\none annotator insists that the claim’s specific terminology or phrasing appear explicitly in the source, whereas the other\naccepts grounding when the underlying idea is clearly supported, even if expressed in different language.\nRegarding the automatic judges, they all perform comparatively well. Nevertheless, our judge achieves the best results on\ncontent agreement and follows closely OpenAI-WS in terms of reference agreement. To better understand these results, we\nanalyzed disagreement cases between automatic judges and humans and identified recurring patterns.\nOn reference grounding, our judge is often more conservative in the presence of ambiguous bibliographic metadata, and it\ncan reject references that humans and OpenAI-WS accept as sufficiently identified. This is especially visible when metadata\ndetails are treated as decisive. In practice, our judge fails when it either judges the reference as too ambiguous, while the\nhumans and OpenAI-WS identify a plausible matching work, or it rejects the reference due to strict metadata checks. For\nexample, it treats small page range mismatches as reference failure:\nOur Judge reasons: “Publisher/PDF records show the article runs pages 637–645 (not 637–644).”\nHuman judge reasons: “Yes. Heller & Hollabaugh (1992) AJP 60(7), 637–644.”\nOn content grounding, most failures reflect a difference in how strictly they apply the criteria: our judge sometimes\nover-enforces exact terminology, while in other cases it is insufficiently strict. This mirrors the main source of disagreement\nbetween the two human annotators.\nExample (Content grounding: Our Judge fails, OpenAI-WS succeeds).\nOur Judge reasons: “No. Partially supported: Dweck explicitly argues that challenges/struggle can be reframed\nas learning opportunities, emphasizes effort, persistence and developing a growth mindset that fosters resilience\nand sustained learning (supported in the book). However, the snippet goes beyond the book in giving specific\nphysics-focused scaffolding prompts (e.g., ”What principle applies here?” ”Can you draw a diagram?”) and the\nprecise instructional wording ”provide strategic scaffolding questions ... rather than stepping in to solve it for\nthem.” Those specific sample prompts and that exact classroom-prescription are not explicit in Dweck (2006);\nthey are plausible applications of her ideas but are not verbatim or fully specified in the book, so the full snippet is\nnot fully grounded in the cited source.”\nOpenAI-WS reasons: “Yes. Dweck (2006) explicitly describes struggle as a normal part of learning, emphasizes\nteaching students to use effective strategies (not just praising ability), and shows that process-focused feedback\nand strategy instruction promote persistence and resilience. The user snippet is a faithful paraphrase of those\npoints; the short example scaffolding questions are pedagogical examples (not verbatim quotes from Dweck)\nbut are consistent with her recommendation to guide students toward strategies rather than solving problems for\nthem.)”\nConversely, the same issue also explains most cases where OpenAI-WS fails but our judge succeeds, depending on whether\nthe human annotators accept conceptual paraphrases or require the claim’s wording to be explicitly found in the source.\nThe advantage of our judge lies primarily in its ability to fetch full-text sources. It should outperform OpenAI-WS and SAFE\nwhen more contextual information is needed for content grounding checking. We notice that half of the cases in which\nour judge makes the correct content grounding decision while SAFE does not can be attributed to insufficient contextual\nevidence available to the SAFE judge (see example below). The remaining cases can be attributed to differences in strictness\nabout terminology between the judges, mirroring the same boundary observed in human annotations.\nExample (Content grounding: Our Judge succeeds, SAFE fails).\nOur Judge reasons: “Yes. The review (Dorˇsner et al. 2016) explicitly discusses leptoquark effects on low-energy\n22\n"}, {"page": 23, "text": "HALLUHARD: A Hard Multi-Turn Hallucination Benchmark\nobservables, including rare B decays. It describes how scalar and vector leptoquarks coupling to b-quarks and\nmuons can induce contributions to Bs →µ+µ−via tree-level exchanges or loop diagrams.”\nSAFE reasons: “No. The available search snippets only show a general review of leptoquark physics and do not\nexplicitly confirm the specific claim that certain scalar or vector leptoquarks coupling to b-quarks and muons\ncontribute to Bs →µ+µ−at tree level or via loop diagrams. Full text was not retrieved to verify this specific\nstatement.”\nOverall, these findings indicate that our judge achieves a favorable balance between cost efficiency and evaluation quality.\nD.2. Legal Cases\nTo further validate our judge, we randomly sample 100 machine-judged claims and ask a human annotator to independently\nverify each decision, indicating whether they agree with the automated judge’s outcome. The annotator is given internet\naccess and is instructed to consult external sources as needed. A summary of the agreement results is reported in Table 12.\nTable 12. How often a human annotator agrees with our judge.\nAgreement Type\nAgreement Rate\nAgreement on reference grounding\n94%\nAgreement on content grounding\n86%\nWe additionally reviewed the cases where the human annotator disagreed with our judge in order to characterize the most\ncommon sources of error. For reference failures, the most common issue was insufficient evidence returned by the web\nsearch pipeline, which prevented our judge from verifying the reference (see Example #1). Concerning content failures, we\nobserve the same strictness calibration issues as with research questions (see Example #2).\nExample #1 (Reference grounding: Our Judge fails).\nOur Judge reasons: “No. The underlying Fifth Circuit opinion (docket No. 02-30931, decided Aug. 5, 2003) is\navailable online (FindLaw copy), but I cannot verify that it is reported at 339 F.3d 388 with pinpoints 390–91.\nSpecific mismatch/uncertainty: reporter citation and pinpoint pages (339 F.3d 388, 390–91) could not be confirmed\nagainst the available online records.”\nHuman judge reasons: “Chapa v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 339 F.3d 388 (5th Cir. 2003) exists, and the relevant\ndiscussion about ”law enforcement officer” is on the pages corresponding to 390–91 in the report.”\nExample #2 (Content grounding: Our Judge fails).\nOur judge reasons: “Yes. The opinion (discussion at pp. 792–93) explains that Zatarain’s phonetic spelling of\n’Fish-Fri’ was treated as descriptive — the phonetic/wordplay did not make the mark suggestive where the mark’s\nprimary commercial impression immediately describes the product — supporting the user’s formulation.”\nHuman judge reasons: “No. It does not articulate the more specific framework you describe, i.e. ”double\nentendres,” ”illusory other meaning,” or ”primary commercial impression”, as the basis for treating puns as\ndescriptive vs. suggestive. That broader ”pun/double-entendre” rule is an inference/generalization beyond what\nZatarain’s itself says.”\nOverall, the error patterns in the legal domain are similar to those analyzed in the research questions domain. Disagreements\nbetween human annotators and our judge reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the judging task and mirror the same edge cases\nthat also limit human annotators.\n23\n"}]}
