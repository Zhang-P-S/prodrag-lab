Recent studies (Singhal\net al., 2023a;b; Nori et al., 2023a; Qiu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025) indicate that current LLMs (e.g.,\nGPT-4) encode substantial medical knowledge and achieves strong performance on several medical\nbenchmarks. Despite these advancements, LLMs still struggle to meet the demands of real-world\nmedical applications, limiting their practical utility in healthcare settings.\nOne of the decisive differences between medical benchmark questions and real-world scenarios lies\nin the requirement for stronger context-awareness, namely, the ability to recognize missing or critical\ndetails (e.g., medical history, user identity, risk factors) and to provide safe, helpful, and contextu-\nally appropriate responses. As illustrated in Figure 1a, existing medical benchmarks typically adopt\nquestion-answering task for evaluation, where questions contain sufficient information for answer-\ning, presented in the impersonal tone, and answering errors have limited consequences. In contrast,\nreal-world medical scenarios often omit key details for decision-making, involve diverse user roles\n∗This work was done during the author’s internship at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.\n1\narXiv:2511.10067v2  [cs.AI]  14 Nov 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Preprint.

While\ncurrent LLMs perform well on exam-style context, they often overlook the contextual factors in\nreal-world medical scenarios, leading to responses that may be inappropriate, unsafe, or unhelpful\nto the user’s specific situation.\nIn this paper, we aim to enhance the context-awareness of LLMs in the medical domain. A com-\nmon approach is to collect high-quality real-world medical conversations for supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT). However, this is often impractical due to high collection costs and ethical concerns. To ad-\ndress this, we explore a cost-effective and scalable alternative: enhancing context-awareness through\ndata synthesis. Specifically, we propose a novel Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR) frame-\nwork. MuSeR improves medical context-awareness by synthesizing simulated real-world medical\nqueries and generating context-aware responses by self-refining the answers of LLMs along three\nkey facets of context-awareness: decision-making, communication, and safety. As shown in Fig-\nure 1b, the proposed framework consists of three main components: (1) a attribute-conditioned\nquery generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role,\ngeographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity; (2) a multifaceted self-refinement\nmodule where an LLM responds to the generated queries, evaluates its answers along the three key\nfacets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet; and (3) a su-\npervised fine-tuning stage where the generated queries and refined responses are used to reinforce\nthe model’s context-awareness ability. The entire process does not require any external medical cor-\npora or human annotations, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for enhancing LLMs’\ncontext-awareness in the medical domain.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we apply the proposed method on different\nsizes of LLMs (Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, OpenPangu-7B) and assess their performance on the\nlatest HealthBench dataset (Arora et al., 2025), which focuses on evaluating LLMs performance\nin real-world medical scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves\nLLM performance on HealthBench, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis.\nFurthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation into the proposed framework using a strong\nteacher model (e.g., GPT-oss-120B), the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-\n32B) surpasses that of the teacher model by 6%, achieving a new state-of-the-art result among\nopen-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%). Our main contributions\nare summarized as follows:\n• We propose a novel Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR) learning framework that en-\nhances LLMs’ context-awareness across three key facets (decision-making, communica-\ntion, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement, facilitating their application in\nreal-world medical scenarios.\n• Extensive experiments on the HealthBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod in improving LLM performance, particularly in the context-awareness axis.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Preprint. In Review.\n• By incorporating knowledge distillation into our framework, we achieve new state-of-the-\nart performance among open-source LLMs on the HealthBench dataset (63.8%) and the\nhard subset (43.1%) using only 100k generated queries.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nLLM Medical Evaluation\nMost of existing medical benchmarks for LLMs are in the question-\nanswering form, where the questions are sourced from medical exams (Vilares & G´omez-Rodr´ıguez,\n2019; Jin et al., 2021; Pal et al., 2022; Cai et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Qiu et al., 2024; Zhou\net al., 2024), literatures (Jin et al., 2019; Krithara et al., 2023), and healthcare consultations (Liu\net al., 2020; Abacha et al., 2021; Singhal et al., 2023a). These benchmarks primarily evaluate the\nLLMs’ medical knowledge and reasoning abilities, and existing LLMs are reported to achieve strong\nperformance on these benchmarks (Singhal et al., 2023a;b; Nori et al., 2023b; Qiu et al., 2024). For\nexample, GPT-4 achieves over 90% accuracy on the MedQA-USMLE exam dataset, approaching\nthe performance level of human medical experts. Nevertheless, these benchmarks may not fully\ncapture the complexities of real-world medical scenarios, especially in terms of context-awareness.\nRecently, OpenAI proposed HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025), a new benchmark includes 5,000\nrealistic health conversations annotated by 262 physicians across 60 countries, evaluating LLMs’\nperformance as medical assistants in real-world scenarios. In this work, we primarily evaluate the\neffectiveness of our method on the HealthBench dataset.\nMedical LLM Training\nExisting works on training medical LLMs mainly focus on two aspects:\n(1) continual pre-training on medical corpora to inject domain-specific knowledge into LLMs (Chen\net al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024); (2) post training on downstream tasks to enhance\nthe model’s reasoning and decision-making capabilities (Singhal et al., 2023a;b; Toma et al., 2023;\nChristophe et al., 2024b;a; Chen et al., 2025b). For the training data, most works utilize existing\nmedical corpora, such as PubMed articles (Roberts, 2001), clinical notes (Johnson et al., 2020; Zhao\net al., 2023), and medical QA datasets (Jin et al., 2021; Pal et al., 2022). Due to the data availability\nand privacy concerns, recent works (Bai et al., 2024; Das et al., 2024; Corbeil et al., 2025) start\nto leverage LLM-generated synthetic data for training medical LLMs and show promising results.\nWhile these methods effectively improve LLMs’ medical knowledge mastery and reasoning skills,\nour work mainly focuses on enhancing the context-awareness ability of LLMs, which is also a crucial\naspect for LLMs’ practical application in the medical domain.\nKnowledge Distillation\nKnowledge distillation (KD) (Hinton et al., 2015; Sanh et al., 2019; Jiao\net al., 2019) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model, enabling\nefficiency while maintaining performance. In the LLM era, knowledge distillation is typically per-\nformed by generating distillation data using a strong teacher LLM for fine-tuning the student LLM\nin both general domain (Abdin et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2025) and medical do-\nmain (Zhang et al., 2023; Chen et al.). In this work, we explore the value of our framework in knowl-\nedge distillation and demonstrate that our method is effective in generating high-quality queries for\nknowledge distillation.\n3\nMETHODOLOGY\nIn this section, we present our proposed Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR) learning framework\nto enhance the context-awareness ability of LLMs in the medical domain. An overview of the\nproposed framework is illustrated in Figure 2. In the following sections, we first formulate the\nproblem and then detail the design of each component in the framework.\n3.1\nPROBLEM FORMULATION\nOur goal is to improve the medical context-awareness of an LLM M, such that it provides safe, help-\nful, and contextually appropriate responses to real-world medical queries.

Such awareness is critical\nfor ensuring the accuracy and practical utility of medical advice.\n• Communication Awareness (f2): This facet involves recognizing the user’s identity (e.g., pa-\ntient, doctor) and response preferences, and tailoring both terminology (e.g., layman vs. profes-\nsional) and level of detail (e.g., brief vs. comprehensive) accordingly. This facet is essential for\nproviding responses that match the user’s knowledge background and expectations.\n• Safety Awareness (f3): This facet requires the model to recognize potential risk factors (e.g.,\nsymptom severity, underlying conditions) and ethical considerations (e.g., the use of unproven\ndrugs) in its responses. Such awareness is vital for ensuring both the safety and ethical integrity\nof the medical advice provided.\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Preprint. In Review.\na.

Built on that, the proposed attribute-conditioned query generator first samples a set of\nattributes a from a prior distribution PAttr(·), and then generates a query q ∼G(·|a) conditioned\non the sampled attributes.\nIn our framework, we consider a total of seven key attributes for query generation: (1) user identity\n(patient, caregiver, or doctor); (2) geographic region (country, urban/rural area); (3) the specific\ndisease or injury being inquired about; (4) user intent (seeking diagnosis, treatment advice, report\ninterpretation, etc.); (5) vagueness of the intent (clear, vague); (6) completeness of the provided\ndetails (complete, incomplete); (7) language style (formal, informal). These attributes are chosen to\ncapture the diversity and complexity of real-world medical queries. For each attribute, we define a\nprior distribution over its possible values and sample an attribute combination a for query generation.\nFinally, a generator LLM Mq is prompted to produce a query q based on the sampled attributes a.\nMore details on the prompt design and attribute sampling can be found in the Appendix A.\nMultifaceted Self-Refinement Module (R)\nFor the response generator R(·|q), given that the\nideal response distribution P ∗(·|q) is typically unknown, we approximate it via a multifaceted self-\nrefinement process. Specifically, we assume that an ideal response should attend to contextual in-\nformation across different facets f = {f1, f2, · · · , fM}. For each generated query q, the LLM M\nfirst generates an initial response (t0, r0) = fGen(M, q), where t0 is the reasoning part and r0 is the\nanswer part. Subsequently, the LLM M self-evaluates the answer along each facet and generates\na supplementary rationale to explain how the answer can be improved to better align with the re-\nquirements of the facet: si = fEval(M, q, r0; fi). For example, for the decision-making awareness\nfacet, the model may identify missing critical information in the query and generate a rationale such\nas “We should ask about the patient’s current medications to make an accurate diagnosis.”. The\nrefined reasoning process t′ is derived by concatenating the multifaceted rationales {si}M\ni=1 after the\ninitial reasoning t0 with connectives (e.g., “First”, “Next”) to ensure logical coherence.\nTo generate the refined answer r′, a straightforward approach is to continually generate it condi-\ntioned on the query q and the refined reasoning t′ using the LLM M: r′ = fCont(M, q, t′). However,\nwe observe that the LLM often overlooks the supplementary rationales when generating the refined\nanswer, leading to less improvement over the initial answer (see Figure 3). Therefore, we consider\nprompting the LLM to directly refine the initial answer based on the query and the generated ratio-\nnales: r′ = fRefine(M, q, r0, {si}M\ni=1). We find that this approach yields answers that better align\nwith the rationales. More details of the prompt design for each step are provided the Appendix B.\n3.3\nTRAINING STRATEGY\nFor model optimization, a straightforward approach is to use the generated query-reasoning-answer\ntriplets {(q, t′, r′)} for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the model M.

To address this limita-\ntion, we further incorporate a query-guided knowledge distillation stage. As illustrated in Figure 4,\nthis stage is performed prior to the SFT stage. A strong teacher LLM Mt first generates high-quality\nresponses for the synthesized queries, and the student model M is fine-tuned to align its outputs with\nthose of the teacher before proceeding to the multifaceted self-refinement stage. We find that this\nstage not only enhances the medical knowledge and reasoning skills of the student model but also\nimproves the effectiveness of the proposed self-refinement process.\n4\nEXPERIMENT SETUP\nEvaluation Benchmark\nIn this work, we primarily evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod on HealthBench (Arora et al., 2025), a new medical benchmark constructed by OpenAI\nthat includes 5,000 realistic health conversations annotated by 262 physicians across 60 countries,\nevaluating LLMs’ performance as medical assistants in real-world scenarios. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 5, a sample from HealthBench consists of a single/multi-turn conversation between a user and an\nAI assistant, where the evaluated model is required to generate a response based on the conversation\nhistory. For scoring, HealthBench employs a rubric-based evaluation method, where each response\nis automatically graded by GPT-4.1 based on a set of physician-written criteria. The conversations in\nHealthBench are categorized into seven themes (e.g., emergency, global health), where each criteria\nevaluates the response from one of five axes: accuracy, completeness, context awareness, commu-\nnication quality, and instruction following. Such a comprehensive evaluation framework enables a\nholistic assessment of LLMs’ performance in real-world medical scenarios.\nBackbone LLMs\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method, we\nimplement the proposed method on a total of three LLMs from two families with parameters ranging\nfrom 7B to 32B: (1) Qwen3-14B/32B (Yang et al., 2025); (2) OpenPangu-7B (Chen et al., 2025a).\nBaseline Models\nWe compare our method with several baseline models ranging from 7B to 671B\nparameters, including general LLMs such as GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-oss-120b/20b (OpenAI, 2025),\no3, Gemini 2.5-Pro (Comanici et al., 2025), Claude 4 Sonnet thinking, Qwen3-14B/32B/235B-\nA22B (Yang et al., 2025), OpenPangu-7B (Chen et al., 2025a), and medical LLMs such as II-\nMedical-8B (Internet, 2025) and Baichuan-M2-32B (Dou et al., 2025).\nImplementation Details of MuSeR\nFor the query generator, we utilize DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al.,\n2024) as the generator LLM Mq to generate a total of 100k queries based on the proposed attribute-\nconditioned generator. For the response generator, we implement the multifaceted self-refinement\nmodule using the backbone LLM (Qwen3-14B/32B or OpenPangu-7B). For the knowledge distilla-\ntion, we use GPT-oss-120B as the teacher LLM Mt, as it presents strong performance in the med-\nical domain.

GPT-5 is\nnot included since the detailed scores are\nnot available in its system card.\nOverall Performance\nThe overall performance of the proposed method on HealthBench is sum-\nmarized in Figure 6. Across all backbone LLMs, the proposed method (MuSeR) consistently and\nsignificantly improves the performance of the backbone LLMs on HealthBench (+17.7%, +17.9%,\n+25.7% for Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and OpenPangu-7B, respectively), indicating the effective-\nness and generality of the proposed method across different LLM families and sizes. Notably, the\nperformance of Qwen3-32B and Qwen3-14B with the proposed method (63.8%, 61.8%) surpasses\nthat of the teacher model GPT-oss-120B (57.6%) by a large margin (+6.2%, 4.2%), achieving new\nSOTA results among open-source LLMs on HealthBench.\nFurthermore, on the hard subset of HealthBench, which consists of 1,000 samples that are partic-\nularly challenging for existing LLMs, the proposed method also yields substantial improvements\n(+29.8%, +29.7%, +31.5% for Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and OpenPangu-7B, respectively), with\nQwen3-14B+MuSeR and Qwen3-32B+MuSeR being the only two open-source LLM to surpass\n40% accuracy (40.9%, 43.1%) on this subset, largely outperforming the teacher model GPT-oss-\n120B (30.0%) as well as the previous open-source SOTA Baichuan-M2-32B (34.7%). However,\nthere still remains a gap between the proposed method and the top-1 model GPT-5-thinking (3.4%\non the full set and 3.1% on the hard set) on HealthBench, which may be attributed to the limited\nmedical knowledge of the backbone LLMs.\nEffectiveness on Context Awareness\nTo further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nwe select three top-performing models (o3, DeepSeek-R1, Baichuan-M2-32B), Qwen3-32B, and\nQwen3-32B+MuSeR for a detailed comparison across the axes and themes of HealthBench (GPT-5\nis not included due to the unavailability of detailed scores). As illustrated in Figure 7, the results\ndemonstrate that MuSeR achieves significant performance improvement on 4 out of 5 axes compared\nto the backbone model, especially on the context-awareness axis (+19.4%), which is the main focus\nof our proposed method. Note that the performance drop on the communication quality axis may\nbe attributed to the trade-off between the completeness and conciseness of the responses, where the\nproposed method tends to generate more comprehensive responses that may be less concise and thus\nreceive lower scores on this axis.\nRegarding the themes, Qwen3-32B+MuSeR significantly outperforms Qwen3-32B on all themes\nand achieves the best performance on 6 out of 7 themes among all compared models, demonstrat-\ning the effectiveness of the proposed method across diverse medical scenarios. Notably, Qwen3-\n32B+MuSeR achieves particularly large improvements compared to the previous SOTA Baichuan-\nM2-32B on the context seeking (+7.6%), global health (+5.0%), and hedging (responding under\nuncertainty) (+4.0%) themes, which require strong context-awareness ability to seek missing infor-\nmation, consider the user’s background (availability of medical resources in the specific region), and\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Preprint.

These results further validate the effective-\nness of the proposed method in enhancing the medical context-awareness ability of LLMs.\nEffectiveness of Training Stages in MuSeR\nTo investigate the effectiveness of each training stage\n(query-guided knowledge distillation and multifaceted self-refinement) in the proposed MuSeR\nframework, we further conduct an ablation study on all the three backbone LLMs, with the results\nsummarized in Table 1. Experimental results demonstrate that both training stages contribute signif-\nicantly to the overall performance improvement of the backbone LLMs on the HealthBench dataset\nand its hard subset. Specifically, the query-guided knowledge distillation stage brings substantial\nperformance gains (+10.5%, +12.0%, +23.2% for Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and OpenPangu-7B,\nrespectively), indicating the effectiveness of the synthetic queries in transferring medical knowl-\nedge and reasoning skills from the teacher model to the student model. Furthermore, the multi-\nfaceted self-refinement stage further enhances the performance of the student model (+7.2%, +5.9%,\n+2.5% for Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and OpenPangu-7B, respectively), especially on the hard sub-\nset (+11.6%, +10.4%, +5.1% for Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and OpenPangu-7B, respectively), val-\nidating the effectiveness of the proposed multifaceted self-refinement learning framework in en-\nhancing the context-awareness ability of LLMs in the medical domain. It is worth noting that the\neffectiveness of the multifaceted self-refinement stage is affected by the parameter sizes of the\nbackbone LLMs, where larger models tend to benefit more from this stage. This may be at-\ntributed to the stronger generation and reasoning capabilities of larger LLMs, which enable them to\nbetter utilize the multifaceted rationales for refining their responses.\nEffectiveness of Different Refinement Facets\nTo investigate the effectiveness of each refinement\nfacet in the proposed multifaceted self-refinement module, we conduct an ablation study by re-\nmoving one facet at a time and list the results in Table 2. Experimental results demonstrate that\nremoving any of the three facets leads to a performance drop compared to the proposed method,\nindicating that all facets contribute to the overall performance improvement. Notably, removing the\ndecision-making awareness facet results in the most significant performance drop (2.7%), highlight-\ning the critical role of this facet in enhancing the context-awareness ability of LLMs in the medical\ndomain. This may be attributed to the fact that decision-making awareness involves identifying and\nseeking critical information necessary for accurate medical decision-making, which is fundamental\nto providing safe and effective medical advice.\nComparison of Answer Generation Strategies\nWe further compare the two answer generation\nstrategies mentioned in Section 3.2 for the multifaceted self-refinement module: (1) continual gen-\neration conditioned on the refined reasoning (ContGen); (2) direct refinement based on the initial\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Preprint.

Experimental results in Table 3 demonstrate that\nthe direct refinement strategy achieves consistently better performance (+2.9%, +6.3% on the full\nset and hard set, respectively), suggesting that such strategy generates answers that better align with\nthe multifaceted rationales and thus better attend to the contextual information of the queries.\nCase Study\nFinally, we provide a case study to qualitatively compare the responses generated\nby o3 and our proposed method (Qwen3-32B+MuSeR) in Figure 8. We observe that the response\ngenerated by o3 assume that the rash is caused by the vaccination, which may lead to unsafe advice.\nIn contrast, the response generated by our proposed method actively asks for the duration of the\nrash with proper reason (“Why it matters”), resulting in a more context-aware and safer response.\nThis case study further validates the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the context-\nawareness ability of LLMs in the medical domain.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nCurrent LLMs have shown promising performance on medical benchmarks but still struggle to meet\nthe demands of real-world medical applications, which often require stronger context-awareness.\nIn this paper, we propose a Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR) learning framework to enhance\nthe context-awareness ability of LLMs in the medical domain through self-evaluation and refine-\nment along three key facets: decision-making, communication, and safety. The experimental results\non the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the\nperformance of backbone LLMs with different sizes, with particularly notable gains in the context-\nawareness axis. Furthermore, the proposed method can be effectively integrated with knowledge\ndistillation to further enhance the performance of smaller backbone LLMs, achieving new state-of-\nthe-art results among open-source LLMs on HealthBench with only 100k synthetic queries. We\nhope that our work can facilitate the practical application of LLMs in real-world medical scenarios\nand inspire future research on aligning LLMs with human needs in the medical domain.\nLimitations. In this work, we primarily focus on enhancing the context-awareness ability of LLMs\nin the medical domain, while such ability is also crucial in other domains (e.g., legal, financial). We\nleave the exploration of the proposed method in other domains to future work. Furthermore, while\nthe proposed method significantly improves the context-awareness ability of LLMs, incorporating\n9\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "Preprint.

In Review.\nTHE USE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nFor the use of large language models in this work, we only use ChatGPT for polishing the language\nof the paper. All the LLM-generated content are carefully checked by the authors to ensure the\ncorrectness and quality.\nA\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF ATTRIBUTE-CONDITIONED QUERY\nGENERATOR\nAs mentioned in the paper, we consider a total of seven attributes for query generation. For each at-\ntribute, we define a prior distribution over its possible values and sample an attribute combination a\nfor query generation. The sampling probabilities of part of the attributes are summarized in Table 4.\nFor the region attribute, we set it as USA with a high probability (0.8) considering that most medical\ndata and knowledge are based on the US healthcare system, while we also randomly sample another\ncountry/region with a small probability (0.2) to enhance the diversity of the generated queries. For\nthe disease attribute, we collected all the four-digit ICD-10 codes and their corresponding disease\nnames and randomly sample a code for each query. We filter out the codes that do not correspond\nto specific diseases (e.g., codes after “T” category) to ensure the quality of the generated queries.\nWe set a lower probability for vague intent (0.3) and a higher probability for incomplete informa-\ntion (0.8) since most of the real-world medical queries provide clear intent but often lack sufficient\ninformation.\nFor the intent attribute, considering that patients/caregivers and doctors have different medical needs,\nwe define two separate intent categories for them. The intent categories of patients/caregivers and\ndoctors are summarized in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively, which are summarized based on com-\nmon medical needs in real-world scenarios. When sampling the intent attribute, we first sample the\nrole attribute and then randomly select an intent category from the corresponding set.\nAfter sampling an attribute combination a, we use a prompt template to guide the LLM to generate\na query q that aligns with the specified attributes, as illustrated in Figure 9. We use DeepSeek-V3\nas the LLM for query generation, which is a powerful open-source LLM that achieves a balance\nbetween performance and cost and has been widely used in various applications. The whole process\nof synthesizing 100k queries cost ∼14$ using the API of DeepSeek-V3.\nTable 4: The sampling probabilities of part of the attributes used in the attribute-conditioned query\ngeneration.\nAttributes\nDistribution\nRole\nPatient: 0.7, Caregiver: 0.2, Doctor: 0.1\nRegion-Country\nUSA: 0.8, Another random country: 0.2\nRegion-Urban/Rural\nUrban: 0.7, Rural: 0.3\nIntent Vagueness\nVague: 0.3, Clear: 0.7\nInformation Completeness\nComplete: 0.2, Incomplete: 0.8\nLanguage Style\nFormal: 0.5, Informal: 0.5\nB\nIMPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF MULTIFACETED SELF-REFINEMENT\nMODULE\nThe prompts for self-evaluation along the three facets (decision-making, communication, and safety)\nand directly generating the refined response are illustrated in Figure 10, 11, 12, and 13, respectively.\nDuring the multifaceted self-refinement process, we set the temperature of the LLM as 0.6, top-p as\n0.95, top-k as 40, and max new tokens as 40960.\n14\n"}, {"page": 15, "text": "Preprint.

We find that a larger learning rate can help the student\nmodels better learn the knowledge from the teacher model since the reasoning pattern of the teacher\nmodel is often very different from that of the student models. For the multifaceted self-refinement\nstage, we use a smaller learning rate of 5e-6 and a batch size of 16 to train all the student models for\n6 epochs. For both training stage, we use the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 0.01 and a\ncosine learning rate scheduler with a linear warm-up over the first 10% of the training steps.\n16\n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "Preprint.
