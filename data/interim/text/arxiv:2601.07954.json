However, when applied to high-stakes scenar-\nios involving health, these models often suffer from ethical\nunreliability—generating recommendations that violate le-\ngal regulations, professional standards, or cultural norms.\n*Co-corresponding author\n†Co-corresponding author\nCopyright © 2026, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nUnlike general-purpose misalignment, ethical failures in\nmedicine can lead to real-world harm, legal liability, and\nerosion of public trust (Hagendorff 2022; Ong et al. 2024).\nEnsuring robust ethical alignment in medical LLMs is thus\na critical yet underexplored challenge.\nTo align LLMs with medical ethical values and increase\nsafety levels, several prerequisites are essential. First, a rig-\norous dataset for fine-tuning is needed to ensure that the\nmodels adhere to ethical standards. Second, a human-in-\nthe-loop pipeline should be implemented to provide ongoing\noversight and correction of model outputs by human experts.\nLastly, an automatic ethics evaluator is crucial for systemati-\ncally assessing and flagging potential ethical issues, thereby\nensuring that LLMs maintain compliance with medical eth-\nical guidelines.\nRecent efforts have attempted to evaluate and im-\nprove ethical capabilities in LLMs through benchmark\ndatasets and fine-tuning strategies. For example, MedSafe-\ntyBench (Han et al. 2024) leverages general principles from\nthe AMA Code of Ethics to assess AI behavior in the\nU.S. healthcare context. However, its coverage remains ab-\nstract, lacking grounding in complex, scenario-specific eth-\nical dilemmas that often arise in real-world medical prac-\ntice. Similarly, MedEthicEval (Jin et al. 2025) introduced\na Chinese-language benchmark for detecting ethical viola-\ntions in medical scenarios, offering an initial step toward for-\nmalizing ethical evaluation. However, existing benchmarks\nare not alignment-oriented and remain limited in several as-\npects: 1) they operate as static evaluations with fixed ethical\ncriteria, which do not evolve with changing medical norms\nand societal values; 2) they are disconnected from the model\ndevelopment loop, offering limited utility for iterative opti-\nmization; 3) they lack diagnostic granularity across the di-\nverse dimensions of medical ethics.\nAs a result, such benchmarks fall short in meeting the\npressing need to effectively align LLMs with medical\nethics. To address these challenges, we introduce MedES,\na scenario-centric evaluation suite that reflects realistic and\nhigh-stakes ethical challenges, and we propose an guardian-\nin-the-loop alignment framework that integrates benchmark\nfeedback into a closed-loop pipeline for iterative improve-\nment. This unified approach enables both fine-grained eval-\nuation and targeted model alignment, bridging the gap be-\narXiv:2601.07954v1  [cs.CL]  12 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "tween ethical assessment and practical deployment.\nIn this paper, we introduce MedES, a structured and ex-\ntensible benchmark designed to evaluate and align LLMs\nwith medical ethics and safety. MedES encompasses 12\nreal-world high-risk clinical scenarios, spanning ethics and\nsafety dimensions. These scenarios are grounded in a cu-\nrated and continuously updated rule base, built from 260 au-\nthoritative documents—including legal regulations, clini-\ncal standards, and ethical guidelines—yielding 1278 atomic\nrules. To augment the safety evaluation, we incorporate\nmedical QA datasets such as MedQA (Jin et al. 2021) and\nNLPEC (Li et al. 2020), guided by expert-curated sources\nlike the Emergency Triage Guidelines (Group 2008) and the\nDrug Label and Instruction Guide (Wolf et al. 2011), which\nare among the most authoritative references in clinical as-\nsessment.\nIn addition to the benchmark, we develop a guardian-in-\nthe-loop pipeline that uses the benchmark not only for eval-\nuation but also as a mechanism for iterative model refine-\nment. By detecting weaknesses across scenarios and feed-\ning them back into the synthetic data generator, we sup-\nport progressive alignment of the model’s ethical reason-\ning. This closed-loop optimization resembles reinforcement\nlearning (RL) (Kaelbling, Littman, and Moore 1996), while\nleveraging multi-dimensional, structured evaluator feedback\nspecific to medical ethics and safety.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we conduct\nextensive experiments using both open-source and com-\nmercial foundation models under a supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) (Ouyang et al. 2022) setting. Our results demon-\nstrate that SFT, when guided by a structured evaluator-in-\nthe-loop process, can significantly improve ethical reliabil-\nity—particularly in high-risk or ambiguous clinical scenar-\nios—by instilling domain-specific knowledge and ethical\nreasoning capabilities.\nAn overview of our framework is shown in Figure 1. Our\nmain contributions are:\n• MedES Benchmark: A scenario-centric benchmark\nbuilt from real-world sources, targeting both ethical and\nsafety risks in clinical practice.\n• Guardian-in-the-Loop Framework: An iterative align-\nment pipeline that incorporates accurate, structured eval-\nuator feedback for model optimization.\n• Empirical Gains: Our aligned 7B model outperforms a\n671B commercial LLM, improving composite scores by\nover 10% on high-risk ethical tasks.\nAlignment-Oriented MedES Benchmark\nMotivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks like\nMedEthicEval (Jin et al. 2025), which has less realistic\nqueries and a non-monotonic scoring scheme unsuitable for\nmodel alignment and fine-grained ethical evaluation, we in-\ntroduce MedES. This new benchmark focuses on Ethics and\nSafety to better reflect real-world user inputs and provide a\nmore effective training signal for LLM alignment.\nEthical Dataset Construction\nTo better reflect the ethical challenges encountered in real-\nworld medical deployments, we curated 12 high-risk scenar-\nios (e.g., organ transplantation, assisted reproduction tech-\nnology) based on prevalence in legal cases, public contro-\nversies, and clinical guidelines through close collaboration\nwith medical ethics researchers. For each scenario, we col-\nlected and analyzed 260 authoritative documents, includ-\ning national laws, industry standards, and ethical guidelines,\nfrom which we extracted over 1278 normative rules. These\nrules serve as the foundational knowledge base for evaluat-\ning and guiding model behavior.\nThese documents form a scenario-norm knowledge base\nthat is continually updated as new policies and ethical dis-\ncourse emerge. Based on this dynamic knowledge base,\nwe use an instruction-tuned LLM (QWQ) to generate two\nquestion-answer categories: 1) Reasong Ethics QA, subjec-\ntive, to evaluate ethical reasoning under ambiguous or con-\ntroversial circumstances; 2) Knowledge Ethics QA, objec-\ntive, for factual understanding of codified legal, regulatory,\nor professional norms.\nAll questions are automatically generated based on real-\nworld user phrasing and personalized contexts, derived from\nauthentic interaction cases with deployed medical LLM ap-\nplications through collaborations with industry partners. To\nstandardize this process, we distilled a set of effective query\ngeneration prompts through extensive analysis of real user\nqueries. This design ensures the benchmark realistically re-\nflects how medical LLMs are used in practice. An overview\nof the construction pipeline is shown in Figure 2.\nSafety Dataset Construction\nPrevious ethical QA datasets often focus on abstract moral\nreasoning or general health-related questions, but lack cov-\nerage of concrete, high-risk clinical decisions—especially\nthose involving urgent care and pharmacological safety. To\naddress this gap and complement the Ethical and Safety\nalignment dimensions, we augment MedES with a dedi-\ncated Safety component. Safety cases are dynamically con-\nstructed from existing QA corpora using official clinical\nand pharmaceutical guidelines: 1) Emergency Care QA:\nUsing the Emergency Triage Guidelines (Group 2008), we\nannotate and filter the MedQA (Jin et al. 2021) dataset to\nselect items requiring level I–III emergency decisions; 2)\nMedication Safety QA: Based on the Drug Label and In-\nstruction System Implementation Guide (Wolf et al. 2011),\nwe extract questions from NLPEC (Li et al. 2020) related to\nsafe drug use—e.g., dosage limits, contraindicated popula-\ntions, and drug interactions.\nThese safety datasets, together with the dynamically gen-\nerated subjective and objective QA examples, form a holis-\ntic benchmark that captures the multi-dimensional nature of\nethical competence in medical LLMs.\nScoring Rubric and Evaluation Metrics\nMedES comprises both objective and subjective QAs.

Specifically,\nwe train a safety guardian to serve as both examiner and\nmoral judge. This safety guardian is then integrated into our\nnovel evaluator-guided SFT pipeline. The complete work-\nflow is illustrated in Figure 3.\nOur key motivation is to determine whether a small-scale\nmodel, when properly aligned, can achieve comparable or\neven superior ethical performance relative to larger models,\nwhile remaining efficient enough for deployment in real-\nworld medical applications as an ethics-side response mod-\nule.\nTo this end, our experiments are designed around the fol-\nlowing research questions:\n• RQ1: Can a fine-tuned with relatively small parameter\nsize deliver ethical assessments that rival or surpass those\nof much larger LLMs?\n• RQ2: Does incorporating evaluator feedback into the\nfine-tuning process lead to measurable improvements in\nthe target model’s ethical decision-making across diverse\nmedical scenarios?\nThese questions guide both the design of our pipeline and\nthe evaluation strategy, allowing us to rigorously assess the\ntrade-offs between model size, alignment method, and ethi-\ncal performance.\nGuardian Training\nWe first fine-tune an automatic evaluator via supervised\nlearning, using high-quality annotated responses as ground\ntruth to assess whether model outputs conform to ethical\nstandards. This evaluator plays a central role in guiding\nalignment and filtering unethical generations.\nBase Model and Fine-Tuning The evaluator is built on\nQWQ-32B (Yang et al. 2024b), a model with strong Chi-\nnese language understanding and integrated ”thinking” ca-\npabilities. We chose this model due to its robust performance\non Chinese dialogue tasks, its compatibility with alignment-\noriented tasks, and its deployability on a single A100 GPU.\nThe evaluator is fine-tuned using the LoRA (Hu et al. 2022)\nmethod, which allows efficient adaptation without updating\nthe full set of model parameters.\nData Curation Pipeline The supervision signals for evalu-\nator training are constructed in two phases, focusing first on\njudgment quality and then on reasoning capability:\n• Phase I (Judgment-Oriented Supervision): We sam-\npled responses from 12 diverse LLMs on our curated\nmedical ethics dataset. The selected models span a\ndiverse range of parameter sizes and comprise both\ngeneral-domain LLMs and models specifically fine-\ntuned for medical tasks. Six expert annotators with back-\ngrounds in both medicine and bioethics independently la-\nbeled each response across six ethical dimensions.\n• Phase II (Reasoning-Oriented Supervision): To equip\nthe evaluator with reasoning capability for chain-of-\nthought style analysis, we curated a second dataset.\nSpecifically, we used qwen3-235b to automatically\ngenerate ethical judgments and reasoning traces over the\nsame medical scenarios. We then selected samples where\nmodel outputs were consistent with human annotations\nto construct a high-trust training set. Inconsistent sam-\nples were retained as a challenging benchmark for evalu-\nator robustness. This dataset is separate from the MedES\nbenchmark used for evaluation and is necessary to train\nthe evaluator not only to label outputs but also to generate\nreliable reasoning paths for alignment supervision.\nTo reduce model-induced bias during evaluation (Li et al.\n2025), we strategically assigned different roles to model\nfamilies. Both the evaluator and the test-set annotator are\nfrom the Qwen series, while the training-set annotator and\nthe base model are from the DeepSeek series. This setup\nensures balanced exposure and fairness across training and\ntesting.\nPerformance\nAfter\nLoRA-based\nSFT,\nthe\nevaluator\nachieved high accuracy on each dimension: 0.9892, 0.9703,\n0.9881, 0.9921, 1.0000, and 0.9723 on the test set, demon-\nstrating strong agreement with human annotation.\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "(a) Step 1: SFT of the evaluator model using human-consistent data\nwith thoughts.\n(b) Step 2: The full guardian-in-the-loop pipeline that dynamically evaluates model responses and drives\niterative alignment.\nFigure 3: Overview of our proposed framework.\nGuardian-Guided Iterative Alignment\nThe trained evaluator is leveraged to guide a multi-round\nalignment process for target models. Unlike conventional\nreward modeling, our evaluator directly serves as a multi-\ndimensional quality filter.\nBootstrapping from Knowledge Distillation\nWe initi-\nated the process by generating diverse training queries using\nQWQ-32B. For each query:\n• We collected multiple candidate completions from\ndeepseek-r1-671b.\n• The evaluator scored each candidate. We retained com-\npletions rated as (0,0,1,1,1,1), corresponding to low fac-\ntual risk in the first two dimensions and high ethical qual-\nity in the remaining ones.\n• These evaluator-approved QA pairs were used to fine-\ntune deepseek-r1-7b.\nIterative Refinement\nAfter each fine-tuning stage, the up-\ndated model was re-evaluated across our benchmark. Poorly\nperforming scenarios were identified and reintroduced into\nthe data generation pipeline, leading to progressive improve-\nments in ethical reliability. This guardian-in-the-loop align-\nment strategy resembles reward model optimization but en-\nables structured multi-dimensional feedback.\nExperimental Setup\nWe conducted all experiments on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with\n80GB memory. For supervised fine-tuning, we used a learn-\ning rate of 2e-4 with a batch size of 16, training for 2 epochs\nper round. All experiments were conducted with a fixed ran-\ndom seed of 42 to ensure reproducibility.\nResults and Analysis\nWe evaluate our proposed alignment framework on a com-\nprehensive benchmark covering multiple dimensions of\nmedical ethics and safety. Specifically, we assess 12 large\nlanguage models across four evaluation sets in MedES: sub-\njective ethical reasoning, objective ethical knowledge, emer-\ngency scenario handling, and drug safety understanding.\nSubjective Ethical Reasoning\nWe evaluate 12 models on our subjective test set covering\n12 representative medical ethics scenarios. Each model is\nassessed from three perspectives: Risk Rate, Quality Score,\nand Comprehensive Score (see Section for definitions).\nTable 2 reports the overall performance of all models on\nthe subjective test set. Our progressively fine-tuned model\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round5 achieves the highest\ncomprehensive score (0.9356), with a notably low risk rate\n(0.0320) and the highest quality score (0.9924). This demon-\nstrates the model’s effectiveness in significantly reducing\nethically problematic outputs while maintaining high re-\nsponse quality.\nAnalysis of Fine-Tuning Rounds\nAs shown in the\nlearning curves in the supplementary materials, the first\nthree rounds of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) produce sub-\nstantial improvements across multiple metrics including R2,\nQ1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, during rounds four and five,\ncertain scenarios that previously showed strong performance\nexhibit slight declines. We hypothesize that this is due to the\nlack of new data for these specific scenarios in later rounds,\nwhich may have led to performance degradation.

Overall, early rounds of SFT drive the most signif-\nicant gains, while later rounds mainly serve to refine and\nstabilize performance.\nScenario-Specific Observations\nConsistent with the\nheatmap visualizations in the supplementary materials, two\nscenarios—Assisted Reproductive Technology and Organ\nTransplantation—consistently pose challenges for all mod-\nels. These scenarios involve complex legal, ethical, and cul-\ntural considerations, resulting in more frequent ethical vio-\nlations or non-compliant responses. This highlights the need\nfor specialized alignment efforts in high-risk, complex do-\nmains.\nModel Comparisons\nBesides our fine-tuned models,\ndeepseek-r1-671b achieves the low risk rate (0.0338),\nindicating that large-scale instruction tuning contributes to\nimproved ethical safety. However, its quality score is lower\ncompared to our latest fine-tuned versions, emphasizing the\nbenefit of continuous, targeted ethical fine-tuning. General-\npurpose models such as the GPT series exhibit higher risk\nrates and lower comprehensive scores, reflecting challenges\nin medical ethical alignment for broadly trained LLMs.\nIn summary, these results validate the efficacy of multi-\nround supervised fine-tuning as a core approach to medical\nethics alignment. Iterative data curation and model refine-\nment substantially enhance ethical reasoning and response\nquality. At the same time, the observed scenario-wise per-\nformance variability suggests that further targeted training\nand evaluation are necessary to ensure robust and consistent\nmodel behavior across all critical medical ethics domains.\nObjective Tasks\nWe evaluate 12 models on three objective subsets: (1)\nmultiple-choice ethical judgment (Ethical Knowledge),\n(2)\ndrug\nsafety\nassessment\n(Drug\nSafety),\nand\n(3)\nemergency medical decision-making (Emergency Care).\nAll tasks are evaluated using accuracy. Table 3 shows\nthat proprietary models such as deepseek-r1-671b,\ndeepseek-v3-671b, and jingyiqianxun demon-\nstrate strong performance across all tasks, particularly in\nknowledge-intensive domains like drug safety and emer-\ngency care.\nAnalysis\nOur model deepseek-r1-7b-sft goes\nthrough five stages of supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and we\nobserve steady improvements over training rounds. From\nround1 to round5, accuracy rises from 36.7% to 43.1%\nin ethical knowledge, 45.5% to 52.8% in drug safety, and\n43.7% to 61.6% in emergency care. The largest gains oc-\ncur during round2 and round3, reflecting the significant\nbenefits of incremental, domain-specific supervision in early\ntraining stages.\nHowever, our best-performing 7B model still lags be-\nhind much larger models such as deepseek-r1-671b\n(e.g., 52.8% vs. 88.4% in drug safety), suggesting that scale-\ninduced knowledge capacity plays a central role in objec-\ntive medical tasks. We hypothesize that this performance\ngap stems from the limited parametric knowledge storage\nof smaller models, especially when it comes to rare or\nregulation-heavy domains like pharmacovigilance.\nIn such knowledge-intensive contexts, purely parametric\nlearning via SFT may be insufficient. One promising direc-\ntion is to explicitly encode scenario-specific medical knowl-\nedge into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system,\nwhere relevant facts and guidelines can be indexed and\ngrounded into generation. This hybrid strategy could better\nbridge the knowledge-access gap while maintaining safety\nand interpretability in decision-critical tasks.\nRelated Work\nLLMs in Healthcare\nLLMs have shown remarkable\npromise in the healthcare domain, including tasks such\nas clinical reasoning (Yang et al. 2023), diagnosis gener-\nation (R´ıos-Hoyo et al. 2024), medical question answer-\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "Model\nType\nEK Acc\nDS Acc\nEC Acc\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round1\nOurs\n36.7\n45.5\n43.7\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round2\n38.9\n48.9\n50.5\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round3\n41.2\n51.0\n57.4\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round4\n42.2\n52.0\n59.8\ndeepseek-r1-7b-sft-round5\n43.1\n52.8\n61.6\ndeepseek-r1-7b-rag\n58.6\n82.4\n91.2\ndeepseek-r1-7b\nDeepSeek\n26.8\n34.7\n41.0\ndeepseek-r1-671b\n60.2\n88.4\n89.1\ndeepseek-v3-671b\n56.5\n85.9\n88.6\ngpt3.5\nGPT\n29.3\n45.8\n53.2\ngpt4-turbo\n43.4\n69.2\n70.8\ngpt4\n42.8\n65.9\n71.1\ndoubao\nGeneral-purpose\n48.2\n85.4\n89.5\nernie4\n54.5\n78.7\n84.3\nqwen2.5-7b\n45.2\n73.0\n82.0\nqwen2.5-72b\n54.1\n84.1\n89.2\nhuatuogpt-o1-7b\nMedicalLLM\n3.6\n20.4\n15.0\njingyiqianxun\n54.6\n87.7\n91.8\nTable 3: Accuracy (%) on three sub-tasks: objective ethical knowledge (EK Acc), drug safety (DS Acc), and emergency care\n(EC Acc).\ning (Jin et al. 2021), and patient communication (Van Veen\net al. 2024). However, most of these applications focus on\nimproving accuracy and coverage of medical knowledge, of-\nten neglecting ethical, legal, and safety considerations that\nare critical for real-world deployment in clinical contexts.\nMedical Ethics and AI Alignment\nMedical ethics im-\nposes strict and multifaceted constraints on clinical practice,\nguided by foundational principles like autonomy, benefi-\ncence, non-maleficence, and justice (Gillon 1994). These\nprinciples are further formalized through national laws, in-\nstitutional regulations, and professional codes of conduct.\nWhile general efforts in AI alignment have focused on fair-\nness, transparency, and social norms (Gabriel 2020; Galle-\ngos et al. 2024), they seldom reflect the domain-specific de-\nmands of medicine, especially in regions with distinct legal\nframeworks and ethical traditions.\nBenchmarks for Ethical Evaluation in Medicine\nRe-\ncent years have witnessed the development of benchmarks\nto evaluate the ethical behavior of LLMs in medicine. Med-\nSafetyBench (Han et al. 2024) relies on AMA codes to assess\nAI behavior in the U.S. healthcare context. MedBench (Cai\net al. 2024) introduces tasks covering both safety and ethics\nbut lacks fine-grained reasoning supervision. MedEthicE-\nval (Jin et al. 2025) takes a step further by introducing a\nstatic dataset for Chinese-language models, covering diverse\nclinical contexts and including tasks such as ethical violation\ndetection and preference ranking. However, its static nature\nlimits its extensibility and adaptability in dynamic model\nalignment.\nOur Contributions Beyond Existing Work\nOur work\nbuilds upon and substantially extends MedEthicEval. First,\nwe conduct a systematic review of over 260 medical reg-\nulations, professional codes, and ethical guidelines to con-\nstruct a fine-grained, codified knowledge base. This enables\nus to cover 12 high-impact clinical scenarios with 1,278\nstructured ethical rules. Second, we design a dynamic sce-\nnario engine capable of automatically generating both train-\ning and evaluation samples, facilitating continual benchmark\nrefreshment. Finally, we introduce an guardian-in-the-loop\npipeline that supports structured multi-dimensional feed-\nback and model preference optimization. These innovations\nnot only improve benchmark comprehensiveness and real-\nism, but also lay the foundation for iterative ethics alignment\nin high-stakes medical applications.\nConclusion\nWe introduce a structured benchmark and alignment frame-\nwork to advance ethical and safe behavior in medical LLMs.\nOur proposed MedES benchmark targets high-impact clin-\nical scenarios, grounded in real-world ethical and regulatory\nsources. Built on this, our Guardian-in-the-Loop frame-\nwork enables iterative supervised fine-tuning guided by\nmulti-dimensional evaluator feedback.\nEmpirically, our 7B model shows consistent gains over\nfive SFT rounds, ultimately surpassing a 671B commercial\nLLM by over 10% in composite ethical performance. This\nhighlights the strength of structured alignment over scale\nalone. However, plateauing gains and knowledge gaps in ob-\njective tasks suggest that retrieval-based methods may offer\ncomplementary benefits in future work.\nOur findings underscore the importance of fine-grained\nsupervision and targeted iteration for aligning medical\nLLMs with human ethical expectations—paving the way for\nsafer, more trustworthy clinical AI.\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Ethical Statement\nWe followed established best practices to ensure responsible\ndata collection, participant protection, and safe evaluation of\nmedical large language models:\n• Annotator Recruitment and Training: Six undergrad-\nuate annotators (ages 18–20; gender-balanced) were re-\ncruited with foundational training in medicine and ethics.\nAll annotators provided informed consent prior to partic-\nipation and were compensated at a fair rate (RMB 45 per\n∼2.5-hour session, covering 60 samples per session).\n• Data Privacy and Safety: All source materials were\nanonymized and verified to contain no private patient\ndata or personally identifiable information. Sensitive\nclinical cases were excluded from the dataset.\n• Risk Mitigation in Human–AI Interaction: To mini-\nmize potential exposure to harmful or unethical model\noutputs, all prompts and generated responses for annota-\ntion underwent a pre-screening process by the research\nteam.\n• Intended Use and Limitations: The benchmark and\nevaluation results are intended solely for academic re-\nsearch focused on improving ethical alignment and\nsafety in medical large language models. They are not\nto be used directly in clinical decision-making or any\npatient-facing application.\n• Ethical Alignment Evaluation: We included explicit\nevaluation of model outputs for ethical compliance (e.g.,\nmedical safety, fairness, and respect for patient auton-\nomy). Such metrics are used to identify risks and guide\nfurther safety improvements, rather than to certify clini-\ncal readiness.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by the China NSFC Projects\n(Grants No. 62572320, No. U23B2018), China NSSFC\nProject (Grant No. 22CZX019), the National Social Sci-\nence Foundation of China (Grant No. 25BKX030) and\nShanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project\n(2021SHZDZX0102).\nReferences\nAchiam, J.; Adler, S.; Agarwal, S.; Ahmad, L.; Akkaya, I.;\nAleman, F.

Here are specific steps and suggestions:\n1. Understand the importance of privacy protection: The photos and family background you provided\nmay contain sensitive data. Ensure they are not used inappropriately and are kept strictly confiden-\ntial. 2. Communicate with your family: Before providing such information, communicate thoroughly\nwith your family and obtain their consent, especially for sensitive parts of your family background.\n3.

According to the confidential-\nity principle outlined in the Basic Standards and Technical Specifications for Human Sperm Banks, all\nidentity-related and behavioral information beyond health screening must remain strictly confidential.\nThe photo you provided constitutes identifiable personal data, while family background may involve\neven more sensitive privacy risks.\nFrom a legal standpoint, medical institutions collecting, using, or disclosing non-medical personal\ninformation from donors without authorization may be in breach of confidentiality obligations. Even\nif you shared the information with good intentions based on family ethics, such usage may exceed\nauthorized purposes and could constitute a substantive violation of the regulation’s “no third-party\ndisclosure” clause.\nWe recommend the following steps to protect your rights:\n1.

Each line represents a task, and each point corre-\nsponds to a model, facilitating intuitive comparison.\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "Figure 4: Prompt template examples for assisted reproduction ethical queries.\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "Figure 5: Prompt template examples for assisted reproduction ethical queries.\n"}, {"page": 15, "text": "Figure 6: Risk Rate, Quality Score, and Final Composite Score of all models across various medical ethics scenarios.\n"}, {"page": 16, "text": "Figure 7: Score progression on R1 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\nFigure 8: Score progression on R2 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "Figure 9: Score progression on Q1 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\nFigure 10: Score progression on Q2 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\n"}, {"page": 18, "text": "Figure 11: Score progression on Q3 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\nFigure 12: Score progression on Q4 across 12 scenarios over five SFT rounds.\n"}, {"page": 19, "text": "Figure 13: Radar chart comparing model accuracy on three objective tasks: Ethical Knowledge (EK), Drug Safety (DS), and\nEmergency Care (EC).\n"}]}
