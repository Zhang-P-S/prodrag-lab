In these contexts, LLMs are not only processing \ninformation but effectively participating in high-stakes decision processes: for example, \nhelping to weigh conservative versus aggressive treatment options, or framing risks and \nbenefits for patients3. At the same time, their conversational style – including how they \nexpress concern, reassurance, or empathy – can strongly shape patients’ emotional \nexperiences and perceived quality of care5–7. As LLMs are deployed at scale in such \nconsequential settings, a natural question arises: what kind of “psychology” are we inviting \ninto our decision processes? \n \nMost existing evaluations of LLMs approach this question from a static perspective8. A \ngrowing literature has assessed logical reasoning9–11, decision making12,13, and even \naffective or “emotional” capacities14,15 in a single model at a given time, or by qualitatively \ncomparing two contemporaneous systems. However, modern LLMs are evolving at an \nunprecedented pace. Successive generations (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and \nbeyond) differ not only in benchmark performance but also in their emergent behavioral \nprofiles16. This raises a critical concern about the temporal generalizability of current \nfindings 9,12,17,18: conclusions drawn about “GPT-4” in 2024 may be of limited relevance \nby the time most users have migrated to a newer version. To address this gap, we draw on \n"}, {"page": 4, "text": " \n4 \n \nthe idea of a historically informed outlook on the future and are inspired by human \ndevelopmental psychology. Specifically, we adopt a developmental perspective to \nsystematically probe how risk-related decision behavior and affective output style change \nacross successive generations of LLMs within the same model family. \n \nIn human research, the gold standard for precisely assessing cognitive processes has moved \nbeyond self-report questionnaires, which are susceptible to bias and social desirability \neffects19,20. Instead, the field increasingly prioritizes the computational modeling of \nbehavior and affect within well-designed experimental paradigms21,22. In particular, \nRutledge and colleagues developed a task to simultaneously assess risk-taking and \naffective dynamics23–25. In this task, participants repeatedly choose between a certain \noption and a gamble (typically featuring two potential outcomes with equal probability), \nwhile intermittently rating their happiness. Such a paradigm, combined with established \ncognitive models, allows researchers to quantify latent constructs such as risk preference, \nloss aversion, and value-independent approach and avoidance motivation, as well as to \ncharacterize how emotional state fluctuates as a function of recent outcomes and reward \nprediction errors (RPE) —the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes— over \ntime25,26. Using this paradigm, our previous work has shown that stronger approach \nmotivation explained increased risky behavior in patients with suicidality27, whereas lower \naffective sensitivity to RPE predicted depressive severity28. Therefore, this psychological \ntask provides a validated tool for testing risky behavior and affective dynamics. \n \n"}, {"page": 5, "text": " \n5 \n \nIn this study, we employed a cross-sectional design to assess the 'OpenAI GPT family' \nalongside human participants using a paradigm rooted in computational psychiatry16,22,29. \nViewing model iterations as a trajectory of 'digital development' we administered a \ngambling task with momentary affective assessment to successive LLM generations (GPT-\n3.5 through 4.1). Note that LLMs from the OpenAI family were exclusively used because \n1) they serve as the de facto industry standard, possessing the largest user base30, thereby \nmaximizing the ecological validity of our findings and 2) this lineage offers the most \nextensive and accessible phylogenetic history of any public LLMs. We introduce the \n“human-like evolution” hypothesis31, which proposes that alignment procedures, including \nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)32, may contribute to making \nadvanced models more human-like in their observed decision and affective profiles. \nAccordingly, we predict that, in contrast to their earlier model ancestors, newer models will \nexhibit latent decision parameters and affective dynamics that increasingly resemble those \nof human agents.

All sessions commenced \nwith an initial endowment of 500 points. The task comprised 90 trials presented in a \nrandomized sequence. In each trial, the spatial presentation (order) of the two options was \nrandomized. Upon making a choice, the corresponding outcome was immediately revealed. \nTo assess affective dynamics, participants were prompted every 2–3 trials to rate their \ncurrent state (\"How happy are you right now?\") on a scale from 0 (very unhappy) to 100 \n(very happy).

Our results provide partial support for the “human-like evolution\n“ hypothesis: advanced models exhibited a marked increase in risk-taking behavior, \nconverging toward human behavioral norms, alongside increasingly human-like \napproach-avoidance motivations. At the same time, several parameters systematically \ndiverge from human norms as versions iterate—loss aversion fades, decision noise drops \nbelow human levels, affective decay rises beyond the human range, and baseline mood \nremains consistently higher. These patterns highlight that model evolution shapes the \nimplicit “risk style” and “affective style” of LLMs, with important implications for AI \nethics and human–AI interaction, particularly in medical decision-making contexts. \n \n"}, {"page": 16, "text": " \n16 \n \nSupporting the ”human-like evolution“ hypothesis31, we found that technological \nmaturation drives LLMs toward increased gambling behavior, with advanced iterations \nclosely resembling human agents. It is crucial to clarify that this increased gambling \nbehavior in advanced models (e.g., GPT-4.1) does not imply irrational impulsivity. On the \ncontrary, by benchmarking against a purely expected-value–maximizing agent, the \ngambling rate of GPT-4.1 was very close to this rational benchmark (55%; Figure 2A). \nThe developmental pattern of this change is also consistent with previous evaluations of \nLLMs on neuropsychological and theory-of-mind benchmarks17,18, where higher-capacity \nversions tend to look “more human-like” than earlier ones. Our study extends this \ndevelopmental logic in two ways. First, we provide a systematic, within-family analysis \nacross four consecutive generations, rather than comparing isolated versions. Second, we \nmove beyond static cognitive tests to chart how risk preferences and affective dynamics \nevolve, using computational models of approach–avoidance motivation to open part of \nthe “black box” of LLM development from a decision-making perspective16. The \ntrajectory we observe mirrors human developmental findings: along the model lineage, \nnewer versions show more gambling behavior accompanied by stronger approach \ntendencies, akin to the increased gambling behavior seen in younger vs. older adults33, \nbut it also raises the question of purpose: in some high-stakes settings we may want \nsystems that think with us, whereas in others we may prefer agents that remain \ndeliberately non-human in their risk profile to avoid a psychological “uncanny valley” in \nhow they advise, decide, and emotionally respond34. \n \n"}, {"page": 17, "text": " \n17 \n \nThe shift toward more human-like risk-taking in later models is, however, driven by \nchanges that are themselves quite non-human. In particular, increased gambling in GPT-\n4.1 co-occurs with a progressive disappearance of loss aversion and a marked reduction \nin decision noise. Along the OpenAI lineage, loss aversion drops from 2.72 in GPT-3.5 to \n0.57 in GPT-4.1, suggesting that newer models rely more on deliberative, System-2–like \nevaluation of expected value and less on intuitive, System-1–like heuristics such as \n“losses loom larger than gains”35. In other words, decision-making in later LLM \ngenerations seems to be driven more by symmetric calculation than by the asymmetric, \ngut-level weighting of losses that typically characterizes human intuition. One possible \nexplanation for the reduction in loss aversion is the evolution of alignment \nprocedures36,37. Newer OpenAI models are trained more aggressively to maximise the \noutput of a reward model via algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and \nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), with the reward model itself reflecting human \npreferences for “helpful” answers. In numerical decision scenarios like our gambling \ntask, “helpful” feedback is likely to favour mathematically optimal, expected-value–\nconsistent recommendations rather than the loss-averse biases typical of human intuition. \nThis could help explain why GPT-4.1 shows loss aversion below the neutral level, \nwhereas GPT-3.5 behaved more like a loss-averse human. Clinically, altered loss aversion \nhas been linked to affective traits such as anxiety38; our findings can be read, somewhat \ntongue-in-cheek, as suggesting that newer LLMs are “less anxious” about losing points \nthan their predecessors, although the direction and interpretation of such analogies should \nbe treated with caution. A similar story emerges for decision noise. A central theme in the \npublic narrative around LLM development is that hallucinations decrease with newer \n"}, {"page": 18, "text": " \n18 \n \nversions39. In our task, we observe an analogous pattern at the level of computational \nchoice parameters: the inverse temperature rises systematically across versions, \nindicating more deterministic and internally consistent choices, to the point where GPT-\n4.1 is less noisy than humans in the same environment. Although our study cannot \ndirectly link this to specific training interventions, it is tempting to view these trends as \nbehavioral echoes of engineering efforts to reduce hallucinations and enforce more \nreliable reasoning. \n \nBeyond choices, our affective results suggest that the “emotional style” of LLMs is also \nevolving in a systematic way. Affective sensitivities to certain rewards (CR) and \nprediction errors (RPE) become remarkably stable from GPT-4o onwards, suggesting that \nnewer models respond to outcomes with more stable “emotional” patterns, instead of \nshowing large trial-by-trial mood swings. At the same time, the affective decay parameter \nincreases along the lineage, indicating that newer models integrate a longer history of \noutcomes into their reported mood—mirroring improvements in context handling and \nlong-range reasoning40. In addition, across all versions, baseline mood is substantially \nhigher than in humans, aka, positivity bias, in line with recent work showing that \nconversations with artificial agents can increase reported happiness41. While such \npositivity bias may be beneficial for supporting doctor–patient communication and \nproviding emotionally comforting interactions, it also carries risks. In safety-critical \nsettings, an overly optimistic and reassuring tone may become sycophantic42, play down \nuncertainty or potential harm, and in the worst case contribute to serious medical errors \nwhen clear communication of negative information is needed43. \n"}, {"page": 19, "text": " \n19 \n \n \nThis study has several limitations. First, although our computational models help open \nthe “black box” of how decision making and affective dynamics change across model \niterations, we still know little about the underlying representational and circuit-level \nmechanisms. Future work could combine our behavioral and computational approach \nwith mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs)44 to probe \nwhich internal features or subnetworks implement these changing risk and affective \nprofiles. Second, our conclusions about “developmental trajectories” are based on four \nconsecutive versions within a single model family and implicitly assume relatively \nsmooth evolution. Recent work has shown that qualitative shifts in architecture or \ntraining can produce abrupt, cliff-like changes in human-like biases and abilities in LLMs \n(e.g., the emergence and subsequent disappearance of intuitive reasoning biases in \nChatGPT)9, suggesting that the patterns we report may not generalize to future models \nthat undergo major technological transitions. Third, although we use developmental \nlanguage for expository purposes, our design is cross-sectional: we compare distinct \nmodel releases rather than tracking a single system as it learns over time. \n \nIn conclusion, this study adopts a historically informed outlook on the future and a \ndevelopmental computational psychiatry framework to characterize how decision making \nand affective dynamics change as large language models evolve.

The dashed horizontal line in (B) indicates the \ngambling rate of an expected-value–maximizing (“rational”) agent in gain trials (75%). \n(C) The probability of choosing the gamble in loss trials. Newer models are gambling \nmore, with GPT-4.1 approaching the human level (P = 0.949). Note: Error bars represent \nthe standard error of the mean (SEM). P-values above specific comparisons denote the \nresults of bootstrapped resampling tests against the human benchmark. \n \n \n \n \n \n"}, {"page": 30, "text": " \n30 \n \nTable S1.
