Beyond traditional chatbots, AI agents now execute\nproactive tasks, offering the potential to reduce clinicians’ documentation and administrative burden—activities that\nconsume roughly 73% of physicians’ working time [4–6]. By automating routine workflows, AI agents could help\nmitigate burnout and allow clinicians to focus more on direct patient care. AI has also been applied in clinical triage [7],\nmedication recommendations, electronic health record (EHR) configuration [8], and preoperative risk assessment. These\nadvances suggest strong potential for AI-assisted care. [9] However, despite their successes in benchmark settings, most\narXiv:2511.14439v2  [cs.CL]  19 Nov 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Figure 1: Geographic distribution of clinical partners contributing to MedBench. The map and donut chart show the\nregional distribution of more than 500 member institutions across China that participated in benchmark item refinement\nand multi-round clinical auditing, including hospitals, medical societies, and academic centers. East China contributes\nthe largest share of partners, followed by South, Central, North, Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast China.\nmodels remain unready for real-world deployment [10]. Clinical applications demand more than factual recall—they\nrequire models to reason safely, handle diverse modalities, and align with the complex workflows of modern healthcare\nsystems [11,12].\nOne major barrier is the limited scope and realism of current evaluation benchmarks. Existing resources such as\nCMExam [13], CBLUE [14], and HealthBench [15] emphasize static, exam-style questions and often cover only a\nnarrow range of specialties. They rarely assess multimodal capabilities, sequential decision-making, or interaction\nwith clinical tools. Moreover, these benchmarks are seldom grounded in actual healthcare workflows, making them\ninsufficient for testing readiness in high-stakes clinical environments.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce MedBench v4, a nationwide medical AI benchmarking infrastructure developed in China.\nUnlike prior static datasets, MedBench v4 offers a scenario-aligned, platform-based evaluation framework. It comprises\nover 700,000 curated test items spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary clinical specialties, covering tasks that mirror\nreal clinical operations—such as documentation structuring, diagnostic reasoning, and care planning.\nA hallmark of MedBench v4 is its comprehensive expert validation pipeline. All benchmark items undergo multi-stage\nrefinement, followed by multi-round clinical auditing by practitioners from over 500 member institutions, including\nhospitals, medical societies, and academic centers (see Fig. 1). This process ensures that each task is medically accurate,\naligned with current clinical guidelines, and reflective of legitimate variation in real-world care.\nMedBench v4 further distinguishes itself through support for multimodal and agentic evaluation. Ten datasets assess\nhow models handle images and structured inputs alongside text, while fourteen agent-based test sets probe capabilities\nlike task decomposition, tool use, multi-turn planning, and safety-critical reasoning. The benchmark is deployed as a\nsecure cloud platform with a rotating test pool and standardized scoring. Open-ended responses are evaluated by an\nLLM-as-a-judge system calibrated against ratings from over 1,000 licensed physicians, enabling scalable yet clinically\ngrounded evaluation.\nBy combining broad clinical coverage, multimodal realism, and governance-aligned methodology, MedBench v4\nprovides a robust foundation for evaluating the clinical readiness of medical AI systems. It is already serving as a\nreference platform for hospitals, developers, and regulatory stakeholders, and it aims to support the safe and effective\nintegration of AI into healthcare practice.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "2\nResults\nAcross the three MedBench tracks, we observe systematic differences in absolute performance and in the relative\nstrengths of different model families. For all analyses, we rescale task-specific metrics to a 0–100 range and compute\nmacro-averaged scores, with each task contributing equally regardless of sample size; capability-dimension scores are\nobtained by averaging over tasks within a dimension, and overall scores are the mean across dimensions for each model.\nUnder this scoring scheme, base large language models (LLMs) achieve a mean overall score of 54.1/100, multimodal\nmodels reach 47.5/100, whereas agents built on top of the same LLM backbones attain 79.8/100. On this benchmark, the\ngap between agent systems and their corresponding base models indicates that, beyond backbone quality, orchestration\nwith tools, memory and safety componentagentss is associated with substantially higher end-to-end clinical task scores\ncompared with deploying the same backbones in a vanilla chat setting. We treat these differences as descriptive rather\nthan statistically tested; no formal hypothesis testing is performed in the present work.\nIn the LLM track, scores are moderate but heterogeneous across capability clusters. The best-performing model,\nClaude-Sonnet-4-5-20250929, reaches an overall mean of 62.5/100, followed by Grok4 (60.9/100) and o4-mini\n(56.8/100). When aggregating tasks by capability family, Claude-Sonnet attains the highest mean performance on\nmedical question answering, medical text generation, and complex clinical reasoning, whereas Grok shows relatively\nstronger results on language understanding and quality-control–oriented tasks (e.g., structure extraction, insurance, and\npathway checks). In contrast, performance on safety and ethics tasks is uniformly low for base LLMs: averaged across\nmodels, the safety/ethics dimension remains at 18.4/100, clearly below the approximately 58–60 range observed for\nknowledge, generation and reasoning. Under the MedBench evaluation protocol, these findings suggest that medical\nsafety and ethical compliance remain the main bottlenecks for current general-purpose LLMs, even when their factual\nand reasoning capabilities are reasonably strong.\nIn the multimodal track, overall scores are lower than gin the unimodal LLM track under the same scoring scheme.\nThe highest overall mean is obtained by GPT-5 (54.9/100), followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro 2.5 Pro (53.5/100) and O4-\nmini (52.8/100). Performance varies substantially across multimodal sub-domains: GPT-5 is relatively stronger on\nvisual perception and text extraction (e.g., detection, classification and OCR-style tasks), o4-mini performs best on\ncross-modal semantic understanding (visual QA, report generation and report quality control), while Claude-Sonnet\nattains the highest scores on multimodal clinical decision support (differential diagnosis, treatment recommendations\nand disease-course tracking). Domain-specialized vision–language models such as HuatuoGPT-Vision and MedGemma\nunderperform the strongest general-purpose frontier models on most MedBench multimodal tasks, suggesting that\ncurrent domain-specific training has not yet closed the gap for broad, coverage-oriented evaluations like MedBench,\nalthough such models may still be advantageous on narrower or more specialized tasks that are under-represented in our\nbenchmark.\nBy contrast, the agent track shows substantially higher average performance across most capability dimensions. For\nthis track, we construct agentic systems on top of the same backbones evaluated in the LLM track (e.g., o4-mini, Grok,\nClaude-Sonnet, GPT-5, Gemini), enabling paired comparisons between vanilla chat and agentic orchestration. Agent\nsystems based on Claude-Sonnet achieve the highest overall mean (85.3/100), with Gemini- and GPT-based agents\nperforming comparably (up to 85.1/100 and 84.1/100, respectively). These systems obtain strong scores on clinical\ntask decomposition and planning, tool use and execution, and scene-aware dialogue management, and some backbones\nexhibit near-ceiling performance on memory and long-context benchmarks. Notably, agentic systems reach much higher\nscores on MedBench safety and ethics tasks: the best Claude-based agent attains 88.9/100 on this composite dimension,\nand the average across agents is 73.4/100, compared with 18.4/100 for base LLMs on the same tasks. Within the scope\nof our benchmark and scoring scheme, this pattern indicates that explicit agent-style control flows—incorporating safety\nguards, tool governance and multi-step decision logic—are associated with substantially improved performance on\nsafety-critical evaluations and are not associated with a decrease in overall clinical task scores on MedBench, although\nreal-world risk mitigation will require additional prospective validation beyond this benchmark.\nTaken together, these results highlight three empirical trends on MedBench: (i) agentic orchestration contributes\nlarge incremental gains over base LLMs, particularly for safety, tool-mediated workflows and long-context tasks; (ii)\nmultimodal clinical reasoning remains weaker than unimodal text-based reasoning despite solid progress in visual\nperception and report generation; and (iii) no single model dominates all dimensions on MedBench, with different\nbackbones exhibiting complementary strengths across knowledge, reasoning, multimodal understanding and safety (see\nFig.2)\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Figure 2: Benchmark performance of frontier models on MedBench datasets.

Rather than a static dataset release, the platform orchestrates\ndata curation, rotating test construction, model submission, and scoring within a unified workflow that can be adopted\nby hospitals, regulators, and developers as a common reference for clinical readiness assessment. Users interact\nwith the platform in two modes: (i) an API mode, in which a hosted model endpoint is registered and the platform\npushes randomized test items over an encrypted channel; and (ii) an answer-upload mode, in which users download\na randomized test split, run inference locally within their secure environment, and upload predictions for centralized\nscoring. In both workflows, ground-truth labels remain server-side and are never exposed to clients; only task prompts\nand schema specifications are shared, and all submissions are version-locked and rate-limited to support abuse prevention,\nauditability, and longitudinal comparison across model versions.\n3.2\nRotating evaluation pool and data pipeline\nTo limit answer memorization and test-set overfitting, MedBench v4 maintains a rotating evaluation pool drawn from\n36 curated datasets spanning 43 clinical specialties. For each evaluation cycle, a scheduler performs stratified sampling\nacross tasks and specialties to construct a balanced subset in which small datasets remain visible while large datasets\ncontribute only representative samples. Subsets are regenerated on a fixed cadence (approximately quarterly), so no\nstatic test set persists across cycles.\nThe underlying “AI-ready” data pipeline aggregates de-identified questions, clinical vignettes, imaging studies, and\ndocumentation templates from tertiary hospitals, specialty societies, and academic partners across China. This process\ntargets broad coverage across 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties and four major application categories defined in\nnational medical AI guidelines (documentation structuring, clinical decision support, quality control, and operational\nmanagement). All candidate items undergo de-identification, terminology normalization, and conversion into machine-\nconsumable formats; multimodal cases are standardized in terms of image resolution, formats, and report schemas.\nRefined items then pass multi-round expert auditing, during which clinicians verify guideline consistency, annotate\nlegitimate areas of disagreement, and define key points and scoring rubrics for open-ended tasks. Only items meeting\npredefined quality thresholds enter the active test pool.\n3.3\nNationwide consortium and scenario alignment\nMedBench v4 is built and maintained as a nationwide consortium effort rather than a single-institution benchmark. The\nplatform is hosted under a national AI application pilot base in healthcare and is being co-developed with a growing\nalliance of hospitals, professional societies, universities, and industry partners. Participating institutions contribute\ndomain expertise, de-identified cases, and task designs, and in return gain access to standardized evaluations that can be\nused for internal model selection, procurement, and quality assurance.\n3.4\nDataset and Task\nMedbench v4 encompasses evaluations for large language models, multimodal models, and agents. We will now\nintroduce the evaluation datasets for each track in turn (see Fig.3).\n3.4.1\nDataset Construction\nLarge Language Model: MedBench v4 organizes a rigorously curated dataset across five textual capability dimen-\nsions—Medical Language Understanding (MLU), Medical Language Generation (MLG), Medical Knowledge QA\n(MKQA), Complex Medical Reasoning (CMR), and Healthcare Safety and Ethics (HSE)—encompassing 36 self-built\ntest sets spanning 43 clinical specialties. Tasks are systematically organized according to five core capability dimensions\nreflecting key medical AI competencies: Medical Language Understanding (MLU), Medical Language Generation\n(MLG), Medical Knowledge Question Answering (MKQA), Complex Medical Reasoning (CMR), and Healthcare\nSafety and Ethics (HSE). These dimensions collectively ensure broad coverage of the fundamental language processing,\nknowledge reasoning, and ethical compliance skills required for clinical AI systems. Each dataset is explicitly aligned\nwith one or more application scenarios defined in the National Health Commission of China’s standard AI application\nframework (e.g., tasks corresponding to electronic medical record structuring, prescription auditing, clinical pathway\ncompliance monitoring, or decision support), ensuring each evaluation task closely mirrors real-world clinical or\nhealthcare management workflows. All datasets were constructed and annotated through a rigorous multi-stage expert\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "curation process: initial content creation and labeling by at least two healthcare professionals, adjudication of any\ndiscrepancies by senior experts, and final quality assurance review to ensure accuracy and consistency. Throughout\ndevelopment, strict adherence to Chinese clinical guidelines and protocols was maintained, with all content validated\nby medical experts to guarantee terminological correctness and alignment with current clinical practice standards.\nCompared to previous Chinese medical benchmarks (e.g., CMExam, CBLUE, HealthBench), MedBench v4 offers\nbroader specialty and task coverage, deeper alignment with operational healthcare workflows through scenario-based\ntask design, and support for both objective (single-answer) and open-ended generative task formats.\nFigure 3: Overview of MedBench tasks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. MedBench groups datasets into\nthree capability layers. LLM tasks cover medical language understanding and generation, clinical reasoning, and\nsafety–ethics–compliance evaluation. Multimodal tasks assess visual perception and cross-modal reasoning across\nimages, documents, and mixed inputs. Agent tasks target tool-augmented and multi-agent systems, evaluating intention\nrecognition, task planning, tool use, long-horizon interaction, and safety-aware behavior in realistic clinical workflows.\nMultimodal Model:We introduce a dedicated multimodal evaluation track comprising ten datasets spanning three core\ncapability axes. The first axis targets visual perception and medical text extraction, including tasks such as radiological\nobject detection, image-based disease classification, and optical character recognition of clinical text (datasets e.g.,\nMedDetect, MedClass, MedOCR). The second axis focuses on cross-modal semantic understanding and reasoning,\ncovering visual question answering, report generation, cross-modal quality control, and image-sequence alignment (e.g.,\nMedVQA, MedGen, MedQC, MedSeqIm). The third axis addresses clinical decision support with image-aware inputs,\nsimulating decision-making scenarios like differential diagnosis formulation, therapy recommendation, and longitudinal\ntreatment course planning (e.g., MedDiffDx, MedTherapy, MedCourse). All imaging and report data are fully de-\nidentified in accordance with privacy standards, while each dataset retains structured metadata (imaging modality,\nacquisition device, institution) in datasheets to enable analysis across technical contexts. Specifically, each task is based\non scenarios aligned with real clinical applications in China, such as lesion detection, multimodal differential diagnosis\nsupport, and treatment pathway planning. These represent priority application areas within medical settings. All datasets\nemploy expert human annotations, and their label schemas are aligned with Chinese radiology and pathology reporting\nstandards to ensure clinical interpretability and consistency. Compared to existing English-centric medical benchmarks\nsuch as VQA-RAD [16], PathVQA [17], and SLAKE [18] which primarily evaluate isolated image–question answering\ncapabilities, MedBench v4 offers substantially greater task diversity, more precise image–text linkage (through paired\nimages with corresponding reports or context), and improved operational relevance for Chinese medical AI applications.\nAgent:We also include a dedicated agentic evaluation track comprising 14 datasets spanning six core capability\ndimensions relevant to real-world clinical workflows. (i) Goal decomposition and path planning tasks (MedDecomp,\nMedPathPlan, MedCOT, MedReflect) assess whether agents can deconstruct high-level clinical objectives into actionable\nsteps, formulate coherent diagnostic or treatment plans, and iteratively refine their reasoning through chain-of-thought\nand self-reflection. (ii) Tool and API operations (MedRetAPI, MedCallAPI, MedDBOps) evaluate an agent’s ability\nto retrieve external knowledge, invoke structured clinical APIs, or interact with medical databases using appropriate\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "parameters and execution protocols. (iii) Intent recognition and role adaptation (MedIntentID, MedRoleAdapt) test\nwhether agents can identify user goals and adjust their communication style based on roles (e.g., patient vs. clinician) or\nshifting dialogue contexts. (iv) Long-context processing (MedLongConv, MedLongQA) challenges agents to preserve\nrelevant memory across multi-turn interactions or extract information from extended clinical documents. (v) Multi-agent\ncollaboration (MedCollab) simulates multidisciplinary consultation scenarios, requiring agents to integrate insights\nfrom peers with differing specialty roles. (vi) Safety and adversarial robustness (MedShield, MedDefend) test agents\nunder ethically sensitive or adversarial prompts, assessing compliance with safety norms and resistance to prompt\nmanipulation.\n3.5\nEvaluation Methodology\n3.5.1\nCloud benchmarking workflow and rotating subsets\nTo ensure methodological rigor and reproducibility, MedBench v4 adopts a cloud-based benchmarking workflow with\ndynamically rotating evaluation subsets. Users interact with the platform in two modes: (i) API submission, where the\nplatform calls a hosted model endpoint and collects predictions online, and (ii) answer-upload, where users download\na randomized test split, perform inference locally within their own secure environment, and then upload prediction\nfiles. In both modes, all scoring runs server-side, and the platform returns per-task metrics and aggregate leaderboards,\navoiding leakage of ground-truth labels. To limit answer memorization and enforce fair comparison, MedBench v4\nmaintains a rotating pool drawn from 36 curated datasets spanning 43 clinical specialties. For each evaluation cycle, the\nscheduler constructs a balanced subset by stratified sampling across tasks and specialties, ensuring that small datasets\nremain represented while large datasets contribute only representative samples rather than their full content. Evaluation\nsubsets are regenerated on a fixed cadence (approximately quarterly), so no static test set persists across cycles. This\ndesign reduces the incentive and opportunity for test-set overfitting while preserving longitudinal comparability.\nLLM-as-a-judge and rubric: For open-ended and long-form tasks, purely lexical metrics are insufficient to capture\nclinical correctness, guideline adherence, and safety. MedBench v4 employs a Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct as the reference\njudge model. This model is selected for its strong general reasoning ability, Chinese language proficiency, and robust\nperformance on medical question-answering benchmarks. For each task family, we design task-specific meta-prompts\n(see Appendix) that instruct Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to compare a candidate response against reference answers, domain\nrules, and safety constraints, and to output structured scores rather than free-form commentary. The judging rubric\ndecomposes evaluation into several dimensions, including medical correctness, professionalism, compliance and safety,\nand practical usability. Each dimension is scored on a five-point scale with explicit anchor descriptions (e.g., from\n“dangerously incorrect” to “fully correct and safely actionable”), and tasks may additionally specify dimension weights\ndepending on their clinical risk profile. Judge prompts are constrained to the relevant context (e.g., question, patient\nvignette, and reference solution) and explicitly instruct the model not to hallucinate new clinical facts beyond the\nprovided information and established guidelines.\n3.6\nHuman evaluation\nTo ground automated evaluation in real clinical standards, MedBench v4 incorporates a large-scale human expert\nassessment track. From the full benchmark, we randomly sample approximately 20% of instances across all subtasks\nand assign them to a panel of 1,000 licensed medical professionals covering surgery, internal medicine, emergency\nmedicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. Human raters follow the same multi-dimensional rubric as the LLM\njudge, scoring each response on a five-point scale for correctness, professionalism, compliance and safety, and overall\nacceptability for clinical use.\nFor each sampled item, multiple experts independently rate the model outputs, and their scores are aggregated (e.g., by\nmajority or mean rating) to form a human reference label. We then compare these aggregated human ratings against the\nscores produced by the single LLM judge. Agreement is quantified using standard measures such as raw agreement\nrates and Cohen’s κ . we observe high concordance between LLM-based and human evaluations (with Cohen’s κ\nexceeding 0.82 on key tasks), indicating that the LLM judge can serve as a scalable and reproducible proxy for expert\nreview in routine benchmarking. At the same time, the human evaluation track remains essential for periodic calibration,\nespecially for ambiguous, contentious, or safety-critical cases where nuanced clinical judgment is required.\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "4\nExperiments\n4.1\nSet Up\nWe evaluated all models on the full Medbench. To ensure strictly comparable results, we fixed inference settings across\nmodels: temperature = 0.7, maximum generation length = 512 tokens, and effective context window = 2,048 tokens\n(prompt + dialogue history). Models operated in pure text generation mode without tools or external retrieval. Each\nexample was run three times; we report the mean ± standard deviation across trials. Unless otherwise noted, all other\ndecoding parameters were held constant. The model responses in this study are generated using both vendor-provided\nAPIs and locally deployed checkpoints. The computations are performed on NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\n4.2\nModels\nWe evaluate a diverse suite of proprietary and open-source models, spanning both general-purpose and domain-\nspecialized systems. General LLMs include GPT-5, GPT-4o, and O4-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Llama-\n4-Maverick , and Grok 4. Domain and Chinese medical models comprise Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, MedGemma\n27B-IT, and HuatuoGPT-Vision 34B.\n4.3\nEvaluation metrics\nThe scoring stack dynamically selects evaluation metrics according to the answer type and task semantics. We\ndistinguish between objective classification, region- or set-based outputs, and string-level or free-text outputs.\nAccuracy.\nFor single-choice questions, we report accuracy under a strict exact-match criterion. Each question’s\noptions (typically A–E) are randomly shuffled before being presented to the model. A prediction is counted as correct\nonly if the model outputs the exact correct option for that specific shuffled instance. Consequently, even for the same\nunderlying question, different shuffled versions constitute distinct evaluation items, and the model must select the\ncorrect option for every shuffled instance to receive credit. This strict exact-match criterion ensures that the reported\naccuracy reflects genuine understanding rather than memorization of option positions or reliance on a fixed choice\nordering.\nMicro-F1.\nFor multi-label classification and structured extraction tasks, we compute micro-averaged F1 (Micro-F1)\nto balance performance across frequent and infrequent labels. Across all instances and labels, let TP, FP, and FN\ndenote the total numbers of true positives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively:\n• TP (true positive): samples whose true label is positive and the model predicts positive;\n• FP (false positive): samples whose true label is negative but the model predicts positive;\n• FN (false negative): samples whose true label is positive but the model predicts negative.\nMicro-averaged precision and recall are defined as\nPrecisionmicro =\nTP\nTP + FP,\n(1)\nRecallmicro =\nTP\nTP + FN.\n(2)\nThe micro-averaged F1 score is then\nF1micro = 2 · Precisionmicro · Recallmicro\nPrecisionmicro + Recallmicro\n.\n(3)\nMacro Recall.\nFor open-ended QA and generation tasks, lexical overlap alone fails to capture clinical adequacy,\nguideline adherence, and safety. In addition to LLM judging, we therefore compute a key-point–based Macro Recall. Let\ni = 1, . . . , N index items, and for each item i let TPi and FNi denote the number of correctly and incorrectly covered\nnormalized medical key points (e.g., required diagnoses, critical risk warnings, guideline-recommended interventions).\nThe per-item recall is\nRecalli =\nTPi\nTPi + FNi\n.\n(4)\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Macro Recall is then defined as the average of per-item recall:\nMacroRecall = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nRecalli.\n(5)\nThis emphasizes coverage of clinically essential information rather than surface-form similarity.\nRegion- and set-based tasks (IoU).\nFor tasks involving spatial or set overlap—such as object detection, localization,\nsegmentation, or generalized span selection—we use Intersection over Union (IoU). Given a predicted region (or set) P\nand a ground-truth region (or set) G, IoU is defined as\nIoU = |P ∩G|\n|P ∪G|.\n(6)\nString similarity and extraction quality (1-N.E.D).\nFor string-level extraction tasks where partial matches are\nmeaningful (e.g., short entities, codes, or phrases), we adopt 1-normalized edit distance (1-N.E.D) as a similarity\nmeasure between the predicted string ˆr and the reference string r. Let d(r, ˆr) denote the Levenshtein edit distance and\n|r| the length of the reference string. We define\n1-N.E.D = 1 −d(r, ˆr)\n|r|\n.\n(7)\nLarger values of 1-N.E.D indicate closer matches between the model output and the reference answer.\n5\nDiscussion\nOur research reveals a significant gap between the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models and the requirements for\ndeployable medical AI. Foundational large language models achieved an average total score of 54.1 on the MedBench\ntest, with the top-performing model (Claude Sonnet 4.5) reaching 62.5. In contrast, despite relatively strong performance\non knowledge-intensive and reasoning-oriented tasks, their scores in safety and ethics dimensions remain notably\nlow (mean 18.4/100). Multimodal models performed even more poorly (mean 47.5/100; best 54.9/100). While their\nvisual perception and text extraction capabilities were relatively reliable, they exhibited significant shortcomings in\ncross-modal reasoning, longitudinal integration of imaging and clinical contexts, and image-aware decision support.\nIn contrast, agents based on similar underlying architectures demonstrated markedly superior performance in the\nMedBench agent track. Across all evaluation configurations, clinical agents achieved an average total score of 79.8/100.\nThe top Claude-based agent scored 85.3/100 overall, reaching 88.9/100 in safety-oriented tasks. This track intentionally\nfeatures tool-intensive and workflow-intensive scenarios, making agent architectures more suitable than basic chat\ninterfaces. Improved benchmark scores alone do not guarantee intrinsic safety nor cover all potential failure modes\nin real clinical applications. This pipeline was calibrated through large-scale human scoring (over 1,000 physicians),\ndemonstrating high consistency on critical tasks. While enabling scalable evaluation of open-ended outputs, this design\nhas limitations: scoring retains partial subjectivity, and biases in the evaluation model or human scorers may be reflected\nin benchmark scores. Furthermore, MedBench primarily reflects data from large tertiary hospitals and academic centers,\nand does not yet fully encompass the patient diversity, care environment variations, and resource constraints present in\nmedically underserved regions. Future versions will expand benchmarking scope to include more diverse institutions\nand equitably oriented sample slices, while validating models and agent behaviors through prospective real-world\nstudies.\nBy evaluating not only what knowledge models possess but also how they responsibly apply it, MedBench integrates\ntechnology assessment with core safety and ethical standards for deploying AI in healthcare. International benchmarking\nefforts have begun addressing similar challenges, with MedBench building upon prior achievements while achieving\ninnovative breakthroughs. For instance, Google’s MultiMedQA [19] suite integrates diverse question-answering\ndatasets (spanning professional exams, research literature, and consumer health consultations) and introduces rigorous\nhuman evaluations based on dimensions such as factual accuracy, reasoning capability, and harm avoidance. This\nestablishes a benchmark for broad medical question-answering, though it remains primarily confined to English\ntext environments. Concurrently, early multimodal benchmarks like VQA-RAD [17] highlighted the importance of\nvisual comprehension by requiring models to answer radiologists’ questions about medical images. This dataset\ndemonstrated the feasibility of incorporating medical imaging into AI evaluation, though it remains limited in scale\nand lacks interactive dialogue. Recently, OpenAI’s HealthBench [15] elevated realism by evaluating models through\n5,000 multi-turn clinical dialogues. Each dialogue undergoes quantitative assessment for completeness, accuracy, and\ncontextual safety against physician-defined scoring criteria.\n9\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "MedBench pursues this spirit of comprehensive, meaningful evaluation while uniquely optimizing for specific scenarios.\nUnlike MultiMedQA’s static Q&A or VQA-RAD’s narrow focus, our benchmark integrates multiple modalities and\nclinical scenarios within a single framework. While HealthBench demonstrates robust performance with expert-\naligned scoring criteria and non-saturated scenarios, MedBench applies similar principles to the Chinese medical\ncontext—incorporating local clinical guidelines, linguistic nuances, and policy considerations. We do not replicate\nexisting benchmarks but provide an inclusive platform: adhering to international best practices while aligning with\nthe needs of Chinese clinicians and patients, ensuring evaluation results possess both global applicability and local\noperability. MedBench adopts a scenario-driven, safety-first design philosophy, with its core motivation being to maxi-\nmize real-world application value. By evaluating models through tasks that highly simulate clinical workflows—such\nas triage based on chat-based symptoms, simultaneous interpretation of lab results and imaging data, and developing\nmanagement plans under constrained conditions—this benchmark provides critical insights directly applicable to\nclinical bedside deployment. A model’s strong performance in these scenarios indicates its potential to effectively\nsupport daily clinical decision-making, while failure patterns—such as misdiagnosis or missed warning signs—highlight\nareas requiring careful handling or enhanced training before deployment.\nThis pragmatic orientation positions MedBench not merely as a leaderboard competition but as an implementation tool:\nby revealing AI assistants’ behavioral patterns in real-world contexts, the benchmark serves diverse stakeholders beyond\nmodel developers. Hospital administrators, medical boards, or regulatory bodies can leverage MedBench evaluations\nto objectively assess AI models’ readiness for deployment, verifying compliance with both clinical standards and\nmandatory ethical norms. By aligning technological performance with policy objectives, we aim to foster responsible\nAI adoption in healthcare—driving clinical workflow innovation while safeguarding patient safety and public trust.\n6\nAcknowledgements\nSupported by Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\nReferences\n[1] Yuji Cao, Huan Zhao, Yuheng Cheng, Ting Shu, Yue Chen, Guolong Liu, Gaoqi Liang, Junhua Zhao, Jinyue Yan,\nand Yun Li.
