Clinical prediction faces several challenges,\namong which are heterogeneity, high dimensionality, and sparsity\nof EHRs [24, 58]. Significant research effort has been dedicated\nto tackle these challenges through the development of machine\nlearning models for a wide-range of clinical prediction tasks in-\ncluding diagnosis prediction [8, 15, 22, 34], mortality prediction\n[5, 15, 34, 36], readmission prediction [15, 18] and length of stay\nprediction [15, 21]. One major agreed-upon finding from these stud-\nies is that leveraging expert knowledge with patient data insights\nenhances EHR modeling, which leads to significant improvement\nin prediction accuracy. Previous studies mostly integrated expert\nsymbolic knowledge in the form of clinical knowledge graphs that\nrepresent medical features (e.g., ICD10 codes of diagnoses) and\ntheir relationships to model valuable contextual information to\ncomplement EHR data [4, 5, 47, 51].\nSubsequently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as\na significant milestone in the transition from symbolic knowledge\nto parametric knowledge, bringing us one step closer to potential\nknowledge graphs with impressive capabilities of language under-\nstanding and generation [38]. To date, there is a large body of work\nshowing the potential of LLMs to perform medical tasks [23, 28, 49].\nIn the literature related to LLM-based clinical prediction, models\nrely on either of the following approaches illustrated in Figure\n1: (a) leveraging fine-tuned pre-trained LLM specialized on med-\nical textual corpora (e.g., Llamacare [28], Llemr [49]). Although\narXiv:2601.19286v1  [cs.CL]  27 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "WSDM ’26, February 22–26, 2026, Boise, ID, USA\nJesus Lovon-Melgarejo, Jose G. Moreno, Christine Damase-Michel, and Lynda Tamine\nFigure 1: Comparison of three LLM-based approaches for\nclinical prediction from EHRs. Approach (a) relies on fine-\ntuned LLMs as EHR encoders. Approach (b) relies on LLMs to\ncomplement EHRs. Our approach, ReToP (c), uses a trainable\nLLM-based EHR rewriter aligned with clinical tasks.\nshowing strong capabilities in interpreting complex EHR features,\nthese works have been evaluated particularly on medical knowl-\nedge understanding tasks (e.g., medical question-answering) and\nusually require a significant fine-tuning cost for achieving general-\nization ability [32]; (b) complementing EHRs with clinical kowledge\nfrom LLMs either agnostically [51] or dependently of EHR data\nbefore training the predictive model [18]. However, these existing\nworks have two main limitations: (1) they have low flexibility in\ndetermining to what extent a certain knowledge is useful vs. noisy\nwhen naively fusing between LLM parametric knowledge and KG\nknowledge [1, 31]; (2) they do not link EHR completion with clini-\ncal prediction. Since knowledge graphs contain a large amount of\nrelational information, complementing EHR with noisy data may\nhinder the prediction accuracy.\nInspired by how human experts diagnose, we raise a critical\nquestion: \"Given the patient EHR, what are the clinical rationales to\nsupport prediction?\" Our work answers this question while tackling\nthe above-cited limitations. We design an LLM-based EHR rewriter,\nacting as the unique source of expert knowledge, able to generate\nfaithful and salient descriptions of the original patient EHR. The\nLLM-based EHR rewriter is further fine-tuned to revise the EHR\nrewrites to better support the clinical prediction. However, the\nimplementation of this answer poses the two following challenges:\n• C1: Given an input patient EHR, the LLM-based rewriter\nmight be able to faithfully recall among a huge number of\nclinical features, the most salient ones, for any prediction\ntask. A potential solution is using an off-the-shelf LLM-based\nEHR rewriter. However, previous work showed that LLMs\nstill struggle to comprehend tabular data, including EHRs\n[33, 45, 46]. Since the gold relevant clinical features of an\nEHR are a priori unknown, the alternative of designing a\ntrainable LLM-based EHR rewriter poses the challenge of a\nlack of gold supervision.\n• C2: The relevant clinical features of EHRs are likely to be\ntask-dependent. Thus, prediction accuracy might serve as\na proxy evaluation of the quality of the EHR rewrite. How-\never, accuracy can only be measured on gold task-specific\ndata, which do not involve patient EHR rewrites but original\npatient EHR instead.\nIn this work, we introduce Rewrite To Predict (ReToP), a new\nLLM-based framework for clinical prediction. As shown in Figure 1\n(approach c), ReToP is composed of two modules. The first module\nrepresents an LLM-based EHR rewriter, and the second module is a\nclinical task predictor. Our framework is generalizable to different\npredictive clinical tasks at the light cost of fine-tuning the predictor\nwithout fully re-training the LLM-based rewriter.\nTo cope with the high dimensionality and sparsity of clinical fea-\ntures and be able to generate faithful EHR descriptions (challenge\nC1), we train the EHR rewriter module using a set of synthetic\npseudo-labels of patient-rewrites in two stages. We first sample\nEHR features to build diverse paraphrases to reduce dimensionality\nwhile covering salient features of the original EHR. Then, we select\nthe top-K paraphrased EHRs as pseudo-labels based on a relevance\nscore that quantifies their clinical utility to a set of representative\nclinical tasks. The selected pseudo-labels are then used for fine-\ntuning the LLM-based EHR rewriter. To align patient EHR rewrite\nquality to clinical prediction accuracy (challenge C2), we propose\nan end-to-end supervised training of the EHR rewriter and clinical\npredictor. The clinical predictor iteratively provides supervision to\nthe LLM-based EHR rewriter, which can then optimize its parame-\nters to generate patient rewrites that help prediction. The predictor\nsupervision quantifies the impact of each patient rewrite on predic-\ntion accuracy by using a Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC)\nscore inspired by the LM Supervised Retriever (LSR) measure [43].\nWe conduct extensive experiments across multiple EHR datasets,\nincluding MIMIC-IV [20], eICU [39], and EFEMERIS [16], as well as\na set of representative clinical prediction tasks: mortality prediction,\nreadmission prediction, length of stay prediction, and congenital\nmalformation prediction. The results show that the ReToP frame-\nwork outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across these\nclinical tasks, achieving improvements up to 23% in AUC-ROC\nscore with a positive effect of each of its components. Furthermore,\nwe show that our framework is generalizable to out-of-domain\ndata and tasks with light computational cost during fine-tuning of\nthe clinical predictor, without additional fine-tuning of the LLM-\nbased EHR rewriter. Finally, qualitative analysis reveals that our\nEHR rewriter preserves faithfulness to the original EHR, and that\nKL alignment can emphasize serendipitous clinical features, not\nexpected by experts, although valuable for accurate prediction.\n2\nRELATED WORK\n2.1\nClinical prediction\nClinical decision-making has made significant progress since de-\nploying deep learning models on EHRs [50]. Early models have\nparticularly tackled the challenge of domain-specific adaptation\nand demonstrated their ability to improve the effectiveness of a\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "ReToP: Learning to Rewrite Electronic Health Records for Clinical Prediction\nWSDM ’26, February 22–26, 2026, Boise, ID, USA\nwide range of predictive clinical tasks, including health failure pre-\ndiction [3, 4, 55], mortality prediction [5, 15, 34, 36], and diagnosis\nprediction [8, 15, 22, 34, 36].\nThe follow-up rise of pre-trained language models (LMs) has\nled to a vast amount of research investigating their capabilities\nto tackle the challenge of EHR data scarcity and clinical language\nunderstanding tasks. Among these models, BEHRT [29], MedBERT\n[40], TransformEHR [54] and ClinicalBERT [14] have particularly\nled to progress in disease prediction. Recently, REMED [22] pro-\nposed a retrieval-based filtering approach to address the sequence\nlength limitations of LMs when processing EHR events.\nIn the same line of transformer-based models, but with more im-\npressive transfer capabilities, decoder-only LLMs have emerged as\npromising tools for predictive healthcare. The first category of work\nfocused on the design of foundation models on EHRs to tailor their\ninherent abilities of multi-tasking and reasoning to clinical applica-\ntions [23, 28, 49]. For instance, Llemr [49] is an instruction-tuned\nmultimodal model based on Llama [30] that jointly encodes vector-\nized EHR event representations with natural language questions,\nevaluated on EHR-based question-answering tasks, and adapted for\nclinical prediction tasks, including mortality, readmission, length-\nof-stay, and diagnosis prediction. The second category of work inte-\ngrates LLMs in the pipeline of a clinical predictive task by achieving\nvarious roles such as supporting clinical reasoning [37, 44] or com-\npleting EHR descriptions to improve the prediction [18, 32, 37, 51].\nEspecially, Jiang et al. [18] propose a framework that relies on LLMs\nprompted to build a graph-based patient representation, which is\nthen used to train a deep neural healthcare predictive model based\non a graph neural network (GNN). Unlikely, Nuguyen et al. [37]\nadopt a retrieval-augmented approach to enhance patient repre-\nsentations using multiple domain-specific resources. The authors\nleverage the LLMs to generate a local patient representation, a\nsummary of knowledge resulting from a retriever queried with\nconcepts from the EHR. This representation is then complemented\nby a patient-visit representation, and both are trained to achieve a\npredictive task.\nOur work is significantly different in that we attempt to improve\nclinical prediction by fine-tuning, instead of zero-shot prompting,\nLLMs to generate the patient EHR rewrites without any external\nknowledge. Furthermore, instead of using task-agnostic enhanced\nEHR representations as input, we show how to train an LLM-based\nEHR rewriter using clinical prediction outcomes as supervision.\n2.2\nLLMs as feature selectors\nRecent work has increasingly explored the application of LLMs as\nfeature selectors [6, 17, 27], leveraging their multi-task ability to\nshift from traditional statistical methods toward more semantically-\naware feature selection approaches. Early work [6] introduced a\nprompt-based approach that formulates feature selection as a binary\nclassification problem. The models generate “Yes” or “No” responses\nbased on log-probability differences between these tokens to indi-\ncate feature importance given task descriptions, target features, and\nfeature descriptions. LLM-Select [17] extensively explored zero-shot\nand few-shot approaches across multiple paradigms, using score-\nbased, rank-based, and dialogue-based methods to elicit feature\nrelevance. Moreover, to address challenges in specialized domains\nwhere LLMs may have limited knowledge of domain-specific fea-\ntures, such as healthcare, RAFS [27] proposed a retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) approach that retrieves relevant feature descrip-\ntions from external knowledge sources.\nHowever, these approaches mainly rely on feature descriptions,\nwhich require specialized domain knowledge that becomes resource-\nintensive when handling large feature sets. Additionally, few-shot\napproaches remain highly susceptible to prompt variations [42, 56].\nIn contrast, our work leverages the LLM’s internal knowledge\nthrough controlled generation by fine-tuning an LLM-based EHR\nrewriter that implicitly operates on feature importance derived\nfrom statistical feature selection heuristics applied to raw EHR\ndescriptions, rather than relying on EHR feature descriptions.\n3\nBACKGROUND AND NOTATIONS\nAn EHR is an individual patient record of a sequence of visits. In\nthis section, we introduce the notions and notations used in our\nwork and formulate the clinical prediction task.\n3.1\nBasic notions\n• Patient EHR. A patient’s EHR 𝑃𝑖is composed of demo-\ngraphic information and longitudinal representation of the\nhealth conditions recorded during a sequence of hospital vis-\nits 𝑉1 . . .𝑉|𝑁𝑖|. Each visit 𝑉𝑒includes a set of feature-value\ntuples T𝑒\n𝑖\n= {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖}𝑇\n𝑡=1 where 𝑡= {1..𝑇} are discrete\ntimestamps during the visit 𝑉𝑒, and feature 𝑓𝑘∈F with\nF = {𝑓1, . . . 𝑓𝑛} a reference set of 𝑛features from different\nmodalities (e.g., demographic, disease, medication).\n• Clinical prediction task. We consider standard healthcare\nprediction tasks 𝑠∈S, where the input space is a population\nof patient EHRs P with each EHR 𝑃𝑖∈P in the form of tu-\nples sampled from Ð𝑇\n𝑡=1 T𝑡\n𝑖with 1..𝑇discrete timestamps,\nand the output space is Y with 𝑦𝑖∈Y is a binary label,\ni.e., 𝑦𝑖= {0, 1}. Given a patient EHR 𝑃𝑖and a clinical task\n𝑠, a predictive function 𝑓outputs the clinical outcome 𝑦𝑖.\nWithout loss of generality, we consider the mortality predic-\ntion, readmission prediction, length of stay prediction, and\ncongenital malformation prediction tasks (§5.2).\n• Patient EHR verbalisation. As done in previous work\n[12, 33, 45, 46], a verbaliser function 𝑣is used to convert EHR\nfeature-value tuples of a patient 𝑃𝑖(i.e., 𝑃𝑖= {Ð𝑇\n𝑡=1 T 𝑗\n𝑖(𝑡)})\ninto a natural language description P𝑖. In this work, we ap-\nplied markdown templates, verbalizing each tuple (𝑓𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑘)\ninto a string “- 𝑓𝑘: 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑘”. We concatenate different feature\nmodalities with headers “# {feature name}”.\nTo simplify the notation, we also refer to 𝑓as the predictive\nfunction that maps a text-based patient EHR P𝑖= 𝑣(𝑃𝑖) to the\nclinical outcome 𝑦𝑖.\n3.2\nProblem statement and solution overview\nReToP employs two trainable parametrized models: a rewrite model\nM𝜃and a task-specific predictor model 𝑓𝜙. Formally, ReToP re-\nframes the prediction function 𝑓that supports the clinical task 𝑠,\nas a joint Rewrite (M𝜃)-To-Predict (𝑓𝜙) model that computes like-\nlihood of outcome 𝑦𝑖conditioned to patient EHR P𝑠\n𝑖.

To enhance the LLM’s\nability to rewrite patient EHRs for clinical tasks, we deploy a\nparaphrasing-based generation approach since it has been shown\nto favor diversity and faithfulness [19, 26]. Unlike previous work,\nwe apply paraphrasing operators over the input patient EHR 𝑃𝑖\nbuilt upon feature-value tuples T𝑒\n𝑖\n= {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖}𝑡. We aim to re-\nduce feature dimensionality and improve clinical feature diversity\nwhile remaining faithful to the original patient EHR. Specifically,\nwe consider a set of clinical tasks 𝑠∈S and we generate for each\ntask and each seed patient 𝑃𝑖sampled from population 𝑠P𝑠⊂P𝑠, a\nset of 𝐾feature-based paraphrases {𝑃𝑖𝑗} 𝑗= 1 . . . 𝐾using operators\ndedicated to EHR data. In our work, we design 𝐾= 8 feature-based\nparaphrasing operators, inspired by previous work in prompt learn-\ning [27, 57], grouped by their feature selection strategy:\nHeuristic-based 𝜋ℎ: we select clinical features based either on\nthe temporal or value criteria given the importance of such criteria\nagnostic to task-specific outcome: 1) 𝜋ℎ\n𝑡: selects the x% more recent\nfeature-value tuples such as 𝑃𝑖1 = Ð𝑇𝑖\n𝑡=𝑠T𝑒\n𝑖(𝑡) with𝑠= (1−𝑥)∗𝑇𝑖; 2)\n𝜋ℎ𝑣selects clinical features with abnormal values based on reference\nranges such as 𝑃𝑖2 = {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖∈T𝑒\n𝑖|(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘< 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑘) ∨(𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘>\n𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑘)} with [ 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑘. . . 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑘] is the range reference of feature 𝑓𝑘.\nData-driven 𝜋𝑑: we apply traditional feature selection meth-\nods that identify task-relevant features: 1) 𝜋𝑑\n𝑚𝑖: filtering by mu-\ntual information [25], 2) 𝜋𝑑𝑚𝑟𝑚𝑟: based on minimum redundancy\nmaximum relevance selection [7], and 3) 𝜋𝑑\n𝑟𝑓𝑒: recursive feature\nelimination [11]. Each method computes a score per feature, and\nwe select the top x% with the highest scoring features. Formally, for\n𝑗∈{3, 4, 5} corresponding to methods {𝜋𝑑\n𝑚𝑖, 𝜋𝑑𝑚𝑟𝑚𝑟, 𝜋𝑑\n𝑟𝑓𝑒} respec-\ntively, we define: 𝑃𝑖𝑗= {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖∈T𝑒\n𝑖\n| score𝑗(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, D𝑠) ≥x𝑠},\nwhere score𝑗(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, D𝑠) denotes the score assigned to feature 𝑓𝑘by\nmethod 𝑗given the dataset D𝑠, and x𝑠is the 𝑥𝑡ℎpercentile thresh-\nold of all feature scores for task 𝑠.\nRandom-based 𝜋𝑟: to favor the diversity of candidate clinical\npredictive features and values while reducing the dimensionality of\nthe EHR, we design two operators: 1) 𝜋𝑟\n𝑓randomly selects a sample\nof clinical features and then corresponding feature-value tuples:\n𝑃𝑖6 = {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖∈T𝑒\n𝑖|𝑓𝑡\n𝑘⊂F }; 2) 𝜋𝑟𝑣randomly selects a subset\nof feature-value tuples from 𝑃𝑖such as 𝑃𝑖7 = {(𝑓𝑡\n𝑘, 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑡\n𝑘)𝑒\n𝑖∈T𝑒\n𝑖\nFinally, we consider the trivial case of the identity operator 3) 𝜋𝑟\n𝐼\nthat simply copies and pastes the original EHR: 𝑃𝑖8 = 𝑃𝑖.\nFor each patient EHR 𝑃𝑖verbalized into P𝑖, we transform each\nof the corresponding paraphrases in {𝑃𝑖𝑗}𝑗=1...8 into a natural lan-\nguage patient description P𝑖𝑗using the verbalizer 𝑣. For each pa-\ntient P𝑖, we generate 𝐾input pairs (P𝑖, P𝑖𝑗). Finally, we obtain\nfor each task 𝑠the dataset 𝑅𝑤𝑠of candidate patient rewrites with\n𝑅𝑤𝑠= {(P𝑖, P𝑖𝑗)𝐾\n𝑗=1 |P𝑖= 𝑣(𝑃𝑖), P𝑖𝑗= 𝑣(𝑃𝑖𝑗)}𝑃𝑖∈𝑠P𝑠.\n4.1.2\nFine-tuning the EHR rewriter.

As we\nformulate the overall clinical prediction task as an optimization\nproblem of the EHR rewriter (§3.2), we propose a further fine-tuning\nof the EHR rewriter M𝜃to align its generation with the likelihood\nof the clinical predictor 𝑓𝜙, as presented in Figure 2. Specifically, we\nbuild a dual training dataset D𝑠\n𝑃𝑟= {(P𝑠\n𝑖, ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖)𝑗=1...𝑛𝑖|(P𝑠\n𝑖,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖) ∈\nD𝑠∧( ˜P𝑖𝑗= M𝜃( ˜P𝑖𝑗|P𝑠\n𝑖)}. This fine-tuning aims to align the\npatient EHR rewriter with the clinical prediction performance, re-\nsulting in more relevant patient rewrite generation. Inspired by\nprevious work [41, 43], we introduce the Classifier Supervised Con-\ntribution (CSC) score, an adaptation of the LM-Supervised Retrieval\n(LSR) score [43], for clinical prediction tasks. Given a training triplet\n(P𝑠\n𝑖, ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖) ∈D𝑠\n𝑃𝑟, the CSC score quantifies the relative effective-\nness of patient rewrite ˜P𝑖𝑗to help accurately predicting the target\nclinical outcome 𝑦𝑠\n𝑖regarding all the candidate rewrites { ˜P𝑖𝑗}𝑛𝑖\n𝑗=1\nof patient P𝑠\n𝑖:\n𝑝𝐶𝑆𝐶( ˜P𝑖𝑗| P𝑠\n𝑖,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖) =\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝(𝑦𝑠\n𝑖| ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝜙)/𝜏)\nΣ(P𝑠\n𝑖, ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖)∈D𝑠\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝(𝑦𝑠\n𝑖| ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝜙)/𝜏)\n(7)\nwhere 𝜏is a temperature scaling parameter. The CSC score mea-\nsures the contribution of a patient rewrite ˜P𝑖𝑗to the correct classifi-\ncation outcome 𝑦𝑠\n𝑖. To make the patient rewriter model M𝜃guided\nby the clinical predictor 𝑓𝜙we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between the language model’s output distribution and\nthe CSC-weighted probability:\nL𝐾𝐿= ED 𝐾𝐿\n\u0010\n𝑝𝐿𝑀( ˜P𝑖𝑗|P𝑠\n𝑖,𝜃) ∥𝑝𝐶𝑆𝐶( ˜P𝑖𝑗|P𝑠\n𝑖,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖)\n\u0011\n(8)\nwhere 𝑝𝐿𝑀( ˜P𝑖𝑗| P𝑠\n𝑖,𝜃) represents the rewriter’s probability\ndistribution over candidate rewrites, defined as:\n𝑝𝐿𝑀( ˜P𝑖𝑗| P𝑠\n𝑖,𝜃) =\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝( ˜P𝑖𝑗| P𝑠\n𝑖,𝜃)/𝜅)\nΣ(P𝑠\n𝑖, ˜P𝑖𝑗,𝑦𝑠\n𝑖)∈D𝑠\n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑝( ˜P𝑖𝑗| P𝑠\n𝑖,𝜃)/𝜅)\n(9)\nwith 𝜅as a temperature scaling factor. The final training objective\ncombines the KL loss with the standard language modeling loss:\nL𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙= 𝜆× L𝐿𝐿𝑀+ (1 −𝜆) × L𝐾𝐿\n(10)\nwhere L𝐿𝐿𝑀is the causal language modeling loss and 𝜆balances\nthe two objectives. To complete the alignment process, we perform\na final inoculation step of our clinical predictor 𝑓𝜙on a small sample\nof rewrites generated by our KL-trained EHR rewriter.\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "WSDM ’26, February 22–26, 2026, Boise, ID, USA\nJesus Lovon-Melgarejo, Jose G. Moreno, Christine Damase-Michel, and Lynda Tamine\n5\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\n5.1\nDatasets\nWe use three EHR datasets in our study: MIMIC-IV [20], a pub-\nlicly available dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\nMIMIC-IV contains clinical data from hospital and ICU stays, and is\nwidely adopted in healthcare research. To assess the generalization\nof our approach, we additionally consider two other datasets: eICU\n[39], which gathers ICU data from many critical care units through-\nout the U.S, and EFEMERIS [16], a private clinical dataset containing\nthe medical history of pregnant women as well as their neonatal\noutcomes regarding baby congenital malformation at birth.\n5.2\nClinical tasks and evaluation metrics\nMortality prediction (MOR) predicts whether the patient will\ndie in the next hospital visit, based on tuples from the current visit.\nFormally, 𝑓: {ÐT\n𝑡=1 T𝑒\n𝑖(𝑡)} ↦→𝑦𝑖[T𝑒+1\n𝑖\n] with 𝑦𝑖[T𝑒+1\n𝑖\n] ∈{0, 1}\ndenotes the patient’s mortality status.\nReadmission prediction (RA) predicts if a patient will be read-\nmitted into hospital within 15 days. Formally, 𝑓: {Ð𝑇\n𝑡=1 T𝑒\n𝑖(𝑡)} ↦→\n𝑦𝑖[T𝑒+1\n𝑖\n] with 𝑦𝑖[T𝑒+1\n𝑖\n] is equal to 1 if Δ𝑇(𝑉𝑒+1,𝑉𝑒) ≤15, 0 oth-\nerwise, with Δ𝑇is a time-interval function.\nLength-of-stay prediction (LOS) predicts whether the pa-\ntient’s hospital stay will be longer than 7 days, using the first 48\nhours of the current visit. Formally, 𝑓: {Ð≤48ℎ\n𝑡=1\nT𝑒\n𝑖(𝑡)} ↦→𝑦𝑖[T𝑒\n𝑖]\nwith 𝑦𝑖[T𝑒\n𝑖] ∈{0, 1} denotes if the stay is longer than 7 days.\nCongenital malformation prediction (MALF) predicts whether\na newborn will present major malformation based on maternal EHR\ndata. Formally, 𝑓: {T 1\n𝑖, T 2\n𝑖, T 3\n𝑖} ↦→𝑦𝑖, where T 𝑗\n𝑖\nrepresents the\nmaternal EHR data from month 𝑗, and 𝑦𝑖∈{0, 1} indicates the\npresence of major malformation at birth.\nWe prepare task-specific cohorts as follows. For MOR and RA\ntasks, we omit patients who are deceased in the current hospital\nadmission. For the LOS prediction task, we exclude patients with a\nlength-of-stay shorter than 48 hours. Table 1 shows the final cohort\nstatistics per task. We followed previous work pre-processing [49]\nfor data preparation across all datasets. First, we exclude patients\nwith more than two ICU stays per hospital admission, and with\nnegative ICU or hospital length-of-stay, and patients under 18 years\nold. We then build our EHR by selecting the following tables: (1) for\nMIMIC-IV, we use hosp/patients, hosp/admissions, hosp/diagnosis,\nhosp/labevents, hosp/microbiologyevents, hosp/prescriptions, and\nhosp/transfers; (2) for eICU, diagnosis, microlab, lab, patient, medi-\ncation, and treatment; and (3) EFEMERIS, demographics and pre-\nscriptions tables. We omit tables capturing dense bedside monitor\nsignals or with substantial overlap with other tables[20, 49]. Finally,\nwe randomly split each dataset into train, val, test sets (80/10/10).\nTo evaluate prediction effectiveness, we use the standard metrics\nfor binary classification problems: the Area Under the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic Curve (ROC) and the Area Under the\nPrecision-Recall Curve (PRC) scores. We report mean scores and\nstandard deviations computed via bootstrap sampling with replace-\nment over 1000 iterations.\nTable 1: Cohort statistics for each task and dataset.\nDataset\nTask (𝑠)\nSize (𝑚𝑠)\n# Neg.\n# Pos.

We\nalso consider foundation models that can process raw EHR with-\nout particular pre-processing, including REMED [22], and Llemr\n[49]; (2) Serialized Classifiers, which convert EHR data into text and\nfine-tune pre-trained language models with classification heads,\nincluding ClinicalBERT [14], Llama (Llama3-8B) [9], Qwen (Qwen\n2.5-7b) [52], and ModernBERT (base) [48]; (3) Rewrite then predict\nmodels, which transform the original EHR input before classifica-\ntion.

All training and evalua-\ntions are performed using CUDA 12.4, PyTorch 2.6.0 and the Hug-\ngingFace Transformers library. We train our models with 4 NVIDIA\nH100 80GB GPUs. To implement the baselines, we use PyHealth\n1.1.6 framework [53] when available. For efficient rewrite genera-\ntion, we use the vLLM 0.8.3 library for accelerated inference. We\nperform grid search optimization for learning rates across all exper-\niments, exploring values in the range {1𝑒−3, 1𝑒−4, 1𝑒−5, 1𝑒−6}.\nFeature selector (𝜋). We implement the data-driven feature se-\nlection methods 𝜋𝑑using the scikit-learn feature selection library.\nFor the heuristic-based approaches 𝜋ℎ, we rely on the available\nclinical normal range values provided within each dataset. Across\nall approaches, following [17], we select the top-𝑥= 30% of fea-\ntures based on their computed relevance scores, and we add missing\nfeatures among the top 10, to complement EHR information.\nEHR rewriter.

The performance increase ranges are\nrespectively up to 38.12%, 33.51%, and 28.84% over respectively the\nEHR-oriented, Serialized classifiers and Rewrite-Then-Predict baseline\nmodels. Notably, we can see that among the Rewrite-then-predict\nmodels, all the feature selector operators ((𝑘) . . . (𝑞)) do not show\nconsistent performance improvements. In contrast, our framework\nwith the ReToP𝐿𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑎model achieves the highest performance\nacross all the tasks, with improvements up to +23% compared to the\nbest-performing baseline (ModernBERT). Specifically, ReToP𝐿𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑎\nobtains improvements of 13.92 for MOR, 1.07 RA, and 0.22 for LOS\ntasks. ReToP𝑄𝑤𝑒𝑛shows similar improvements, demonstrating\nthe robustness of our framework.\nFinally, performance analysis across all the tasks raises an im-\nportant observation: imbalanced tasks such as MOR with only 2%\npositive cases (§ Table 1), leverage greater benefit from the Re-\nToP framework (+23%) compared to more balanced tasks like RA\nand LOS tasks with larger training sets (with nearly twice the size\nof RA and MOR sets). This trend suggests that our rewrite-based\napproach provides greater value for rare clinical events, where\nhigh-quality synthetic representations can effectively address data\nscarcity, which is a common challenge in clinical prediction tasks.\n6.2\nAblation study\nWe conduct comprehensive ablation studies to analyze the impact\nof different components of our ReToP framework at the training\nstage, with the following scenarios:\n(1) w/o D𝑅𝑤: we replace our synthetic dataset generation D𝑅𝑤\nwith zero-shot LLM rewriting. Specifically, we replace D𝑅𝑤\nby Ð\n𝑠∈S{(P𝑖, M0\n𝜃(P𝑖𝑗|P𝑖))1≤𝑗≤4}P𝑖∈P𝑠, with 4 rewrites per\nEHR (w/o Algorithm 1).\n(2) w/o Rewriter: we use an off-the-shelf LLM, M0\n𝜃, instead of\nthe M𝜃EHR rewriter (w/o step 1, Fig. 2).\n(3) w/o KL: we train the LLM rewriter without the KL divergence\nloss, removing the alignment between the rewriter and the\nclinical prediction objectives (w/o step 3, Fig. 2).\nWe report our results in Table 3. Consistent with our main re-\nsults, Llama3-8B demonstrates marginally superior performance\ncompared to Qwen2.5-7B across all the ablation scenarios. We can\nobserve that ablating the EHR alignment component (w/o KL) causes\nthe most important performance degradation across both backbone\nLLMs, with the most pronounced effects on the imbalanced MOR\nprediction task. Specifically, we can see that substantial PRC drops\nof 31.5% and 41.8% for Qwen and Llama, respectively. Similarly,\nfor the RA task, we observe a degradation between 4.7% and 6.3%.\nFor the LOS task, we observe a more modest degradation between\n2.4% and 3.6%, suggesting that KL training provides critical value,\nparticularly for tasks with severe class imbalance.\nAblating the fine-tuning of the EHR rewriter (w/o Rewriter) fol-\nlows similar degradation patterns, with the MOR task suffering\nfrom a decrease of 31.5% and 20.5%, for Qwen and Llama in PRC\nscores, respectively. This proves that fine-tuning the EHR rewriter\nis an equally crucial step in our pipeline.\nFinally, we observe that removing our synthetic training dataset\n(w/o D𝑅𝑤) has the most pronounced impact on the LOS task, indi-\ncating that pseudo-label augmentation provides greater value for\ntasks with larger training sets where diverse synthetic examples\ncan capture broader clinical patterns.\n6.3\nModel transferability\nWe evaluate the transferability of the ReToP framework on unseen\ndata, namely, eICU1 and unseen task, namely, MALF with the EFE-\nMERIS dataset. We use the rewriter of each corresponding task2.\nWe adopt a low-cost adaptation approach, implementing efficiency\nmeasures at both model and data levels. Rather than fine-tuning the\ncomplete ReToP framework (> 8𝐵params.), we train only the clin-\nical predictor with 149𝑀params. (1.8% of total). For data efficiency,\nwe limit rewritten data to the test set and 4000 training samples\n(equivalent to 3.6% of the largest dataset) for predictor inoculation.\nWe use our best baseline classifier (ModernBERT). Due to compu-\ntational constraints, we evaluate on 20% of the test set for LOS\nand MALF tasks. As shown in Table 4, ReToP𝑄𝑤𝑒𝑛and ReToP𝐿𝑙𝑎𝑚𝑎\nimprove PRC scores up to +1.97%, +0.46%, and +9.94% for MOR, RA,\nand MALF tasks, correspondingly, while maintaining competitive\nLOS performance. These results demonstrate generalization with\nminimal adaptation cost, particularly for highly imbalanced tasks\n(MOR, RA, and MALF) with up to 3.05% positive examples.\n6.4\nModel analysis\nEffect of interpolated prediction. We evaluate the impact of the\ninterpolation parameter 𝛼(§ Eq. 2) for leveraging original EHRs and\nrewrites at the inference stage. Figure 3 shows ROC performance\nacross different 𝛼values (blue curves), where 𝛼= 0 represents\nthe inference with no rewrites, and 𝛼= 1, using the EHR rewriter.\nAligned with our previous findings, optimal values are task depen-\ndent. MOR benefits more from rewrite-only input, showing that\nour EHR rewriter mitigates sparsity and noise characteristics of\nmortality-related EHR data. Conversely, RA and LOS benefit from\nno rewrites (𝛼= 0), suggesting that preserving full clinical detail\nis more valuable than noise reduction. Figure 3 further stratifies\nperformance by EHR length. For the MOR task, rewrites (𝛼= 1)\nconsistently outperforms across all the input lengths. However, for\nRA and LOS, short EHRs show little differences between original\n1We defined our clinical task at the ICU visit instead of the hospital visit following [53]\n2For MALF, we select the best EHR rewriter among the 3 tasks.\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "WSDM ’26, February 22–26, 2026, Boise, ID, USA\nJesus Lovon-Melgarejo, Jose G.

For 𝜆≤0.25, training is noisy with early overfitting ex-\ncept for RA. MOR is more sensitive to 𝜆, benefiting from stronger\nregularization early on, while RA and LOS remain robust across\n𝜆values. Our results suggest regularization should consider class\nimbalance.\n7\nCASE STUDY\nOur aim here is to check and then get insights into the faithfulness\nand clinical value under the expert perspective of the best ReToP\nsetting. To achieve this goal, we qualitatively analyze a sample of\n15 patient EHRs where ReToP accurately predicts the MOR task.\nFor each case, we collect rewrites from self-gen, ReToP w/o KL, and\nfull ReToP using Llama backbone model. Annotators blindly evalu-\nate each rewrite on two criteria using three labels (’Yes’, ’Partially’,\n’No’): (1) Faithfulness: whether the rewrite is entailed by the original\nEHR, judged by three reviewers including one expert, and (2) Ac-\ntionability: whether the rewrite includes clinical features that likely\nsupport the clinical decision-making, annotated by one expert.\nTable 5 shows the results in terms of ratios for each label and each\nmodel on Faithfulness and Actionability criteria. Overall, ReToP w/o\nKL shows higher faithfulness than ReToP and self-gen (based on the\n’Y’ annotation) and lower faithfulness after KL, leading to a decrease\nof the ’Y’ and an increase of the ’P’ and ’N’ annotations. This trend is\nconsistent with the expert annotation on the actionability, showing\nan opposite pattern on Actionability criteria. We can see that self-gen\nis more likely to include expected predictive features by the experts\nthan the w/o KL model and, more importantly, the full ReToP\nscenario, with nearly half of the annotations (46) revealing the\nincreasing presence of unexpected features for the expert. All these\nresults bring two important insights of the ReToP framework: (1)\nthe EHR rewriter (w/o KL) intrinsically outputs EHR rewrites that\nare faithful to the original ones, as targeted in addressing challenge\nC1; (2) the KL alignment between the EHR rewriter and clinical\npredictors revises the rewriter by emphasizing predictive clinical\nfeatures, in addressing C2, but which are seemingly serendipitous\nfor the expert regarding the clinical task at hand.\nWe dig into these results with a qualitative analysis on Figure 5.\nExamining faithfulness across all the rewrites, self-gen preserves all\nthe original features but introduces unfaithful information (high-\nlighted in yellow). For instance, while the original EHR indicates\n“Alcohol abuse, unspecified, the self-gen rewrite adds complemen-\ntary information stating that “... alcohol abuse may impact his\nmedication, not present in the source data. In contrast, both Re-\nToP-based rewrites lean to filter features rather than adding new\nTable 5: Qualitative analysis of ReToP (w/o and w/ KL models)\nvs. self-gen on MOR based on faithfulness and actionability.\nModel\n% Faithfulness\n% Actionability\nY\nP\nN\nY\nP\nN\nself-gen\n60\n40\n0\n80\n20\n0\nReToP (w/o KL)\n73\n27\n0\n0\n100\n0\nReToP\n71\n22\n7\n7\n47\n46\n# Demographics: gender: M, age: 91\n# Diagnosis: (30 diagnosis) Atrial flutter, \nSyncope and collapse, Arthropathy, \nunspecified..,Ulcer of other part of foot, \nAlcohol abuse, unspecified, Injury to \nbladder and urethra, without mention of \nopen wound into cavity.\n# Procedures: (2 procedures)\n# Prescriptions: (24 prescriptions) Rifampin \n(300mg Capsule), Bisacodyl ..\n# Laboratory:  (51 tests) Blood White Blood \nCells Hematology, Blood Sedimentation \nRate Hematology ..\n# Microbiology: (4 tests) …\n# Demographics: Gender: Male, Age: 91\n# Diagnosis: (30 diagnosis) Atrial flutter, \nSyncope and collapse…, Alcohol abuse, \nunspecified, Injury to bladder and urethra, \nwithout mention of open wound into cavity.\n# Procedures: (2 procedures)\n# Prescriptions: (24 prescriptions) Rifampin \n(300mg Capsule), Bisacodyl ..\n# Laboratory:  (51 tests) Blood White Blood \nCells Hematology, Blood Sedimentation \nRate Hematology ..\n# Microbiology: (4 tests) …\n# Additional Considerations: ...The patient’s \nhistory of alcohol abuse may affect his \nmedication adherence and overall health. ...\n# Demographics: gender: M, age: 91\n(Diagnosis and procedures omitted)\n# Prescriptions: (24 prescriptions) Bisacodyl \n(10mg Suppository), FoLIC Acid \n(5mg/mL-10mL), Cephalexin (500 mg \nCap), Vancomycin (1g Frozen Bag), ... \nMultivitamins (1 Tablet), Lorazepam (1mg \nTablet), Rifampin (300mg Capsule) …\n# Laboratory:  (40 tests) Blood Platelet \nCount Hematology, Blood Hematocrit \nHematology..\n# Microbiology: (3 tests) Urine culture on \nurine, MRSA screen on MRSA screen, \nAerobic Bottle Gram Stain on blood culture\n# Demographics: gender: M, age: 91\n(Diagnosis and procedures omitted)\n# Prescriptions: (24 prescriptions) \nOxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  (5mg \nTablet), Multivitamins (1 Tablet), Bisacodyl \n(5 mg Tab), FoLIC Acid (5mg/mL-10mL), \nSodium Chloride 0.9%  Flush (Syringe), \nRifampin (300mg Capsule)... \n# Laboratory:  (34 tests) Blood Platelet \nCount Hematology, Blood Hematocrit \nHematology, Urine Epithelial Cells …\n# Microbiology: (2 tests) Blood culture, \nurine culture on urine\nRewrite self-gen\nOriginal EHR\nRewrite ReToP w/o KL\nRewrite ReToP\nFigure 5: Example patient EHR for the MOR task.

Interestingly, we can see\nthat ReToP w/o KL reduces diagnoses from 30 to 24 and laboratory\ntests from 51 to 40, while ReToP further reduces tests to 34, re-\ntaining only task-relevant features that optimize prediction. This\nwould explain the decrease in actionability according to the expert\nperspective and opens avenues of research for model explanability\nabout the underlying reasons to filter.\n8\nCONCLUSION\nWe introduced ReToP, a new framework that leverages LLMs to\nenhance clinical prediction performance. ReToP trains an LLM-\nbased EHR rewriter using synthetic EHR rewrites built upon health-\nrelated feature selection methods. Then, ReToP refines the EHR\nrewriter through an end-to-end training guided by the clinical pre-\ndictor supervision using a KL loss. ReToP significantly outperforms\na set of state-of-the-art baselines across representative clinical pre-\ndiction tasks. Our proposed framework exhibits reasonable transfer\nability to out-of-domain datasets and tasks. By designing EHR\nrewriters that can be efficiently aligned with downstream clinical\ntasks, ReToP opens up potential directions for effective healthcare\nAI systems. Future work could explore extending this framework\nto a wider range of clinical tasks, including multi-label classifica-\ntion tasks, and investigating the right compromise between model\nperformance and model explainability for domain experts.\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "WSDM ’26, February 22–26, 2026, Boise, ID, USA\nJesus Lovon-Melgarejo, Jose G.
