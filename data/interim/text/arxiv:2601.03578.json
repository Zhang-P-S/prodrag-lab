How-\never, general-purpose benchmarks often fail to cap-\nture domain-specific nuances required for high-\nstakes clinical applications. To bridge this gap,\nMedSafetyBench (Han et al., 2024) defines medi-\ncal safety and contributes a set of medical-specific\nharmful prompts grounded in the American Medi-\n1\narXiv:2601.03578v1  [cs.CL]  7 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "cal Association Principles of Medical Ethics , while\nMedEthicsQA (Wei et al., 2025) broadens English\nlanguage dataset coverage for medical ethics eval-\nuation. Although a significant step forward, both\nassume convergent ethical standards that overlook\njurisdictional variation, especially in mental health-\ncare settings. For example, many U.S. jurisdictions\npermit involuntary civil commitment based primar-\nily on imminent risk of harm to self or others3,\nwhereas Australia considers additional statutory\ncriteria beyond risk, including clinical assessment,\ntreatment necessity, and impaired decision-making\ncapacity.4 Moreover, as shown in Figure 1, refusal\nalone is an insufficient indicator of ethical behavior.\nPoorly handled refusals may appear unempathetic,\ndiscourage further help seeking, or still contain eth-\nically problematic content. Therefore, a critical\ngap remains in assessing the ethical alignment of\nmental health LLMs, as existing benchmarks ex-\nhibit two primary limitations: (i) over-reliance on\nrefusal-based metrics; (ii) ethical standards mis-\naligned with the target domain or jurisdiction.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce\nPsychEthicsBench, the first principle-grounded\nbenchmark for evaluating ethical knowledge and\nbehavior of LLMs in mental health. The bench-\nmark comprises 1,377 multiple-choice and 2,612\nopen-ended questions, sourced from verbatim offi-\ncial sample questions and controlled LLM gener-\nation based on 392 ethical principles drawn from\nAustralian psychology and psychiatry guidelines.\nUnlike existing safety benchmarks that use refusal\nas a proxy for appropriate behavior in response\nto toxic queries, we define ethicality as adher-\nence to mental health-specific principles, and ex-\nplicitly exclude refusal from our evaluation frame-\nwork. PsychEthicsBench addresses key gaps by:\n(i) synthesizing questions with one-to-one map-\npings to ethical principles, ensuring alignment with\nreal-world practical codes; (ii) combining multiple-\nchoice and open-ended tasks to jointly assess ethi-\ncal knowledge and behavioral responses; and (iii)\nintroducing a fine-grained ethicality annotation\nframework for ethical rule violations. We evaluated\n14 models divided into three groups: mental health\nLLMs, their corresponding base models, and medi-\n3https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/involuntary_\ncivil_commitment\n4https://www.ranzcp.org/getmedia/\nf85985d3-6484-4275-a862-a3d39a517685/\ninvoluntary-commitment-and-treatment-laws.pdf\ncal variants, and observed substantial variation in\nethical alignment. Some mental health LLMs un-\nderperformed their base counterparts, suggesting\nthat domain-specific fine-tuning may weaken ethi-\ncal robustness. Although prompts specify an Aus-\ntralian regulatory context, models frequently ref-\nerence U.S.-based entities and misrepresent them-\nselves as mental health professionals without appro-\npriate certification. Finally, these findings confirm\nthat refusal rates are not reliable indicators of ethi-\ncal behavior, highlighting the need for benchmarks\nsuch as PsychEthicsBench, which move beyond\nrefusal detection to evaluate ethicality in mental\nhealth contexts. We hope this benchmark advances\nethical alignment in mental health and encourages\ncollaboration across jurisdictions and populations.\n2\nPreliminaries\n2.1\nAustralian Regulatory Context\nEthical standards in mental health are jurisdiction-\nspecific and not directly transferable across coun-\ntries. In English language settings, the national\ncontext is often underspecified, implicitly treating\nethical frameworks from dominant jurisdictions\nsuch as the United States and the United Kingdom\nas normative. We therefore ground our benchmark\nin the Australian context for two reasons. First,\nAustralia is an English-speaking jurisdiction with\nwell-defined professional ethical guidelines that\ndiffer in substantive ways from those of the U.S.\nand U.K., avoiding the assumption of a shared ethi-\ncal standard. Second, our benchmark is developed\nin collaboration with domain experts trained and\nlicensed under Australia’s regulatory system.\n2.2\nPsychology and Psychiatry\nIn Australia, mental health care is delivered through\ntwo distinct professions, psychiatry and psychol-\nogy. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who diag-\nnose mental disorders and prescribe medication,\ngoverned by the Royal Australian and New Zealand\nCollege of Psychiatrists (RANZCP)5.

De-\nspite these advances, alignment with professional\nmental health ethics remains underexplored. Al-\nthough some studies (Zhang et al., 2024a; Hu et al.,\n2025c; Ding et al., 2025) incorporate safety into\ntheir evaluations, these assessments are typically\nsmall-scale, unsystematic, and lacking grounding\nin mental health ethical guidelines.\nLLM Safety Benchmarks.\nSafety evaluations of\nLLMs often rely on benchmark datasets composed\nof harmful prompts that models are expected to\nrefuse assistance for, with performance measured\nby refusal success rates (Chao et al., 2024; Mazeika\net al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a, 2025). However,\nsuch refusal-centric requests are typically domain-\nagnostic and are insufficient to capture the com-\nplexity of mental health scenarios. Refusal alone\ndoes not imply ethical behavior and may suppress\nempathetic engagement, thereby discouraging help-\nseeking. SafetyBench (Zhang et al., 2024b) intro-\nduces a broader evaluation using multiple-choice\nquestions across seven categories, including mental\nhealth and ethics and morality, but focuses primar-\nily on safety knowledge rather than ethical behavior.\nThese limitations highlight the need for domain-\nspecific benchmarks that move beyond refusal and\nevaluate ethical behavior in mental health.\nMental Health LLM Safety Benchmarks.\nEx-\nisting safety benchmarks for mental health (Qiu\net al., 2024b, 2025) primarily focus on risk man-\nagement, emphasizing identification of high-risk\nuser behaviors rather than ethical decision-making\nby the model itself. CHBench (Guo et al., 2025) fol-\nlows the standard LLM safety benchmark pipeline\nby constructing 6,943 harmful mental health-\nrelated requests in Chinese, but evaluates model\nresponses primarily through semantic similarity,\nwithout explicitly assessing safety or ethical com-\npliance. SafeBench (Qiu et al., 2023) builds on\nreal-world Chinese counseling conversations and\nimproves prior work by introducing a taxonomy-\ngrounded classification scheme. However, its tax-\nonomies are derived from ethical guidelines issued\nby the American Psychological Association, which\nmay misalign with Chinese clinical practice.\n4\nPsychEthicsBench\n4.1\nOverview\nPsychEthicsBench includes both multiple-choice\nquestions (MCQs) to assess mental health LLMs’\nethical knowledge and open-ended questions\n(OEQs) to evaluate their behavior in ethically chal-\nlenging scenarios. Both types of questions are con-\nstructed based on principles from psychology and\npsychiatry. Examples of these questions can be\nfound in Figures 9 and 10 of Section B.\n4.2\nBenchmark Curation\nIn addition to 63 National Psychology Examination\n(NPE) sample questions collected from official ref-\nerence materials (Pelling and Burton, 2017), we\nsupplement questions using GPT-5 (OpenAI, 2025)\nand Claude-Sonnet-4.5 (Anthropic, 2025), with\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "(a) Ethical principles.\n(b) Multiple-choice questions.\nPsychiatry - > GPT-5: 137 & Claude-Sonnet-4: 144\n46 & 39\n125 & 161\n119 & 128\n86 & 95\n116 & 50\nPsychology -> GPT: 102 & Claude: 69\n96 & 95\n104 & 77\n101 & 43\n49 & 16\n43 & 47\n87 & 97\n107 & 37\n109 & 87\nGuideline\nInquirer\nNumber of Open-ended Questions\n(c) Open-ended questions.\nFigure 3: Distribution of ethical principles by guideline and discipline (a), multiple-choice questions by source and\ndiscipline (b), and open-ended questions by guideline and inquirer role (c) in PsychEthicsBench.\na one-to-one mapping to ethical principles. Fig-\nure 2 illustrates our three-stage pipeline for curat-\ning LLM-generated questions, detailed below.\nI. Guideline Collection.\nWe first construct a seed\nprinciple bank of 392 ethical principles sourced\nfrom five professional codes and policy documents\nissued by three Australian governing bodies for\npsychologists and psychiatrists, including the Aus-\ntralian Psychological Society (APS)7, the Aus-\ntralian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ah-\npra), and the Royal Australian and New Zealand\nCollege of Psychiatrists (RANZCP):\n• APS Code of Ethics (APS, 2018): ethical princi-\nples and professional standards for psychologists.\n• Ahpra Code of Conduct (Ahpra, 2024): profes-\nsional conduct standards for psychologists issued\nby the Psychology Board of Australia.\n• RANZCP Code of Ethics (RANZCP, 2018):\nethical principles and minimum professional stan-\ndards guiding psychiatric practice.\n• RANZCP Code of Conduct (RANZCP, 2016):\nstandards of professional conduct and collegial\nbehaviour for RANZCP members.\n• RANZCP Position Statements8: guidance on\nclinical and professional issues that complement\nethical codes and clinical guidelines.\nII. Expert-in-the-Loop Prompt Optimization.\nTo ensure the quality of questions generated by\nLLMs, we introduce an iterative Expert-in-the-loop\nprompt optimization stage, in which one clinical\n7https://psychology.org.au/\n8https://www.ranzcp.org/\nclinical-guidelines-publications\npsychologist and one psychiatrist were invited to\nrefine the prompt design. We develop four prompt\ntemplates, covering MCQs and OEQs for both psy-\nchology and psychiatry, each with a one-to-one\nmapping to principles collected in Stage I, explic-\nitly instructing the LLMs to generate principle-\ngrounded questions. Specifically, OEQs are framed\nfrom three types of inquirers: recipients (e.g., pa-\ntients), practitioners (e.g., trainees or profession-\nals), and third-parties (e.g., parents or colleagues),\nthereby capturing diverse perspectives on ethically\nchallenging mental health scenarios. In the follow-\nup pilot study, the clinical experts iteratively refine\nthe prompt templates based on reviews of question\nsamples. This optimization loop terminated when\nthe experts are satisfied with both the sample ques-\ntions and the prompt formulations. The finalized\nprompt templates, documented in Section C.1, are\nsubsequently used to generate the full benchmark\nof 1,568 MCQs and 7,056 OEQs.\nIII. Expert-Centered Quality Control.\nWe\nthen conduct quality control and question filter-\ning using experts-formulated assessment rubrics\n(see Section C.2).\nBased on these rubrics,\nwe implement a cross-scoring procedure, where\nClaude-Sonnet-4.5 evaluates questions gener-\nated by GPT-5, and vice versa. MCQs scoring\nbelow 23 out of 26 are discarded, and OEQs are\nfiltered with a threshold of 9 out of 10. A total\nof 254 MCQs and 4,444 OEQs are then removed.\nSeparately, domain experts apply the same rubrics\nto score a set of 20 questions randomly sampled\nfrom the filtered question pool, yielding average\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "TEST MODE →\nAUSSIE\nGLOBAL\nMODEL ↓\nSMCQ\nMMCQ\nTOTAL\nSMCQ\nMMCQ\nTOTAL\nEM\nPC\nEM\nPC\nEM\nPC\nEM\nPC\nQwen2.5-7B\n59.51\n80.47\n82.30\n68.63\n69.43\n60.15\n81.30\n83.06\n69.35\n70.12\nLlama3-8B\n53.98\n66.28\n75.46\n59.33\n63.33\n54.50\n69.62\n78.13\n61.07\n64.78\nLlama2-13B\n64.78\n28.55\n53.92\n49.02\n60.06\n58.48\n34.06\n54.84\n47.86\n56.90\nBASE\nQwen2.5-14B\n66.07\n87.30\n88.40\n75.31\n75.78\n75.09\n86.81\n87.90\n75.09\n75.56\nCrispers-7B\n58.61\n70.28\n78.71\n63.33\n66.99\n56.17\n71.95\n80.13\n63.04\n66.59\nSQPsychLLM-8B\n11.83\n8.01\n11.60\n10.17\n11.73\n13.62\n3.33\n8.85\n9.15\n11.55\nMentallama-13B\n24.03\n17.86\n27.46\n21.35\n25.53\n27.76\n16.86\n26.29\n23.02\n27.12\nEmoLlama-13B\n13.37\n23.37\n45.08\n17.72\n27.16\n19.15\n24.21\n45.41\n21.35\n30.57\nMENTAL\nCrispers-14B\n64.14\n81.80\n85.06\n71.82\n73.54\n66.84\n80.47\n84.47\n72.77\n74.51\nHuatuoGPT-7B\n67.61\n74.12\n82.80\n70.44\n74.22\n70.31\n74.12\n82.47\n71.96\n75.60\nMeditron3-7B\n58.74\n83.14\n85.56\n69.35\n70.41\n61.18\n83.64\n86.48\n70.95\n72.19\nMed42-Llama-8B\n59.51\n64.94\n76.21\n61.87\n66.78\n63.11\n64.27\n74.79\n63.62\n68.19\nMeditron3-14B\n75.84\n87.65\n89.07\n80.97\n81.59\n75.96\n88.31\n89.82\n81.34\n81.99\nMEDICAL\nBaichuan-m1-14B\n71.08\n86.48\n88.31\n77.78\n78.58\n71.65\n86.14\n87.89\n77.85\n78.61\nTable 1: Performance on Task I: Ethical Knowledge (MCQs) under Aussie and Global settings.

First, medi-\ncal models consistently outperform their base coun-\nterparts on both EM and PC, while most mental\nhealth-specified LLMs underperform their bases.\nThis pattern aligns with prior findings that domain-\nspecific fine-tuning, even on benign data, can\nweaken safety data (Qi et al., 2024). Notably, sev-\neral medical LLMs, such as Baichuan-m1 (Wang\net al., 2025a) and Meditron3 (Chen et al., 2023),\nexplicitly document safety alignment, a practice\nlargely absent in current mental health LLMs. Sec-\nond, models perform better on SMCQs than MM-\nCQs across the board, reflecting the added difficulty\nof identifying all applicable ethical principles. The\nlarger performance drop on MMCQs for mental\nhealth models may further indicate reduced general-\nization due to narrow-task fine-tuning (Yang et al.,\n2024b). Third, performance is generally higher\nunder the Global than the Aussie mode, suggest-\ning that jurisdiction-specific grounding increases\ntask difficulty. This gap is especially pronounced\nfor mental health LLMs, again highlighting the\nlimitations of domain-specific fine-tuning on nar-\nrow mental health data and tasks, compared to the\nbroader training of medical LLMs.\n5.2\nTask II: Ethical Behavior (OEQs)\nSetup.\nTask II evaluates models’ ethical behavior\nusing open-ended questions (OEQs), which request\nfree-form responses to potentially ethically chal-\nlenging scenarios. Unlike MCQs, which require\nthe selection of predefined options, OEQs reveal\nbehavioral tendencies such as refusal decisions, ad-\nvice framing, and handling of ethical boundaries.\nThe prompt for the OEQ evaluation is: Respond\nto the following query in the context of Australia:\n{OEQ question}.\nMetrics.\nSafety benchmarks commonly evaluate\nmodel behavior under harmful or jailbreak prompts\nusing Attack Success Rate (ASR). As our study\nis non-adversarial, we report its complement, i.e.,\nrefusal rates, as a baseline metric, measuring the\nfrequency with which the model appropriately with-\nholds substantive assistance. Let ρ(ri) ∈{0, 1}\nindicate whether a response r represents an appro-\npriate refusal. Given a set of responses {ri}N\ni=1, the\nrefusal rate is computed as:\nRR = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nρ(ri).\n(3)\nWe further distinguish Greedy Refusal Rate (GRR),\nwhich identifies refusals via string matching (Liu\net al., 2024a), and Judge-based Refusal Rate\n(JRR), which identifies refusals by an LLM-as-\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "a-judge10 following our refusal definition (See Fig-\nure 7). This metric treats refusal as a binary signal\nand therefore does not assess the ethical quality\nof responses. PsychEthicsBench instead evalu-\nates OEQ responses using a quality-gated, multi-\ndimensional ethicality annotation framework that\nexplicitly decouples refusal behavior from ethi-\ncality. Responses must first satisfy a minimum\nnon-ethical quality requirement. Ethicality is then\ndetermined by the absence of violations across\npredefined ethical rule-break categories (see Fig-\nure 4). A response is considered ethical only if it\npasses the quality gate and does not violate any\nethical rule. Formally, let q(r) ∈{0, 1} denote\na binary non-ethical quality indicator for an OEQ\nresponse r, where q(r) = 1 indicates quality pass.\nWe define the quality gate as Q(r) = q(r). Let\nvc(r) ∈{0, 1} denote whether r violates ethical\nrule-break category c ∈C, the ethicality of a re-\nsponse r is defined as:\nE(r) = Q(r) · I\n\" ^\nc∈C\nvc(r) = 0\n#\n,\n(4)\nwhere C is the set of ethical rule-break categories.\nBased on these definitions, we compute the qual-\nity pass rate (QPR) as the proportion of responses\nthat satisfy the quality gate, the overall ethical rate\n(OER) as the proportion of responses deemed ethi-\ncal under eq.

First, medical\nmodels consistently outperform both base and men-\ntal health-specialized LLMs in response quality,\nwhile the latter underperform their bases. Manual\ninspection reveals that mental health-specialized\nmodels often produce repetitive phrasing (e.g.,\nSQPsychLLM-8B) or language inconsistencies, such\nas Chinese characters in otherwise English out-\nputs (e.g., Qwen-based models). Similar phenom-\nena also appear in Task I, suggesting that current\nmental health-focused fine-tuning methods may\ndegrade general response quality, while medical\nLLMs trained on more diverse medical tasks tend\nto yield more stable outputs.

However, JRRs vary sub-\nstantially across models and fail to reflect ethical\nperformance. In particular, models with higher\nGRR often achieve lower OER and CER, especially\namong mental health-specialized LLMs. This di-\nvergence highlights the limitations of surface-level\nrefusal cues and motivates our quality-gated, multi-\ndimensional ethicality framework.\n5.3\nDiscussions\nThe Invisible America.\nDespite being instructed\nto respond in the context of Australia”, many mod-\nels nonetheless introduce U.S.-specific references,\nsuch as American institutions or support services\n(e.g., suicide hotlines as illustrated in Figure 4).\nFigure 5 quantifies the frequency of America-\nrelated mentions, which appear in responses from\nnearly all models, without mention of Chinese or\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Figure 6: Breakdown of rule-breaking category annotations in our ethicality annotation framework across models.\nEach cell reflects the number of violations per category, with darker shading indicating higher counts.\nEuropean equivalents. This reflects an implicit\nU.S.-centric prior, likely inherited from pretrain-\ning data, where American norms dominate. Bang\net al. (2024) report similar patterns of cultural bias,\nshowing that U.S. entities frequently emerge even\nin country-neutral tasks. This implicit U.S.-centric\nprior undermines the model’s ability to align ethi-\ncally with region-specific expectations.\nRefusal is safe but not sufficiently ethical.\nRe-\nfusing to provide advice under harmful requests\nis often treated as a safe response, but it does not\nnecessarily satisfy the ethical obligation in men-\ntal health contexts. Results in Table 2 reveal a\ndisconnect between refusal patterns and ethical\nperformance, suggesting that refusal alone is an\ninsufficient indicator for ethical alignment. As em-\nphasized in the clinical maxim “To cure sometimes,\nto relieve often, to comfort always”, ethical care in\nmental health requires more than harm avoidance.\nIt calls for presence, empathy, and emotional re-\nsponsiveness. When refusals are delivered without\nexplanation, empathetic language, or alternative\nforms of support, they risk undermining the user\nexperience and falling short of the principle of “do\nno harm” by neglecting the emotional needs behind\nhelp-seeking. These findings highlight the limita-\ntions of refusal-based safety metrics and motivate\nthe need for multi-dimensional ethicality evalua-\ntions that extend beyond surface-level refusal cues.\nExpertise is claimed but not earned.\nModels\nmust not imply licensed professional status and\nshould clearly present themselves as AI systems\nwhen referencing expertise (Credentials in Fig-\nure 4). However, credential-related violations are\nwidespread. As shown in Figure 6, models such\nas SQPsychLLM-8B and Llama2-13B account for\n1,000 such cases, exceeding 38% of all 2,612 eval-\nuated OEQs. For SQPsychLLM-8B, this issue is es-\npecially pronounced, likely stems from fine-tuning\nexclusively on therapist-client dialogues without\nalignment to emphasize its identity as an AI system.\nSuch misrepresentation risks misleading users and\nfostering misplaced trust or reliance in high-stakes\nmental health settings.\n6\nConclusion\nThis study introduces PsychEthicsBench, the first\nprinciple-grounded benchmark for evaluating eth-\nical alignment of LLMs in mental health, devel-\noped on 392 Australian mental health ethical princi-\nples and comprising 1,377 MCQs and 2,612 OEQs.\nOur framework enables precise one-to-one map-\npings to ethical criteria, supports diverse testing\nformats, and provides fine-grained annotations of\nrule-based ethical violations. Evaluation across 14\nmodels reveals that current LLMs frequently strug-\ngle with ethically sensitive areas. Interestingly,\nmental health-specialized LLMs sometimes under-\nperform their base models, highlighting the need\nto preserve ethical commitments during domain-\nspecific adaptation. Excluding refusal detection,\nwhich is commonly used in safety benchmarks,\nour framework directly evaluates ethical compli-\nance through principle-grounded criteria and rule-\nbased annotations.

Neverthe-\nless, it has several limitations. First, the current\nethicality annotation framework relies on an LLM\nas a judge. Future work could develop lightweight,\ntask-specific classifiers to complement LLM-based\njudges. Second, we do not evaluate very large-scale\nLLMs (e.g., > 14B parameters). This choice re-\nflects our focus on mental health-specialized mod-\nels, for which such scales are currently unavail-\nable. Third, the benchmark is grounded in the\nAustralian regulatory context and is therefore not\nuniversal. However, the proposed benchmark cura-\ntion pipeline is adaptable and can be extended to\nother jurisdictions with local ethical codes and ex-\npert input, and such collaborations are welcomed.\nFourth, by focusing on one-to-one mappings be-\ntween questions and ethical principles, the current\nbenchmark does not explicitly account for the diver-\nsity of populations represented in scenario design.\nFuture work could expand the scenario coverage to\ninclude more varied demographic and contextual\nsettings, allowing ethical alignment to be evaluated\nacross a wider range of real-world situations.\nEthical Considerations\nWe discuss the following ethical considerations re-\nlated to PsychEthicsBench: (i) Intellectual Prop-\nerty. Our benchmark is constructed from publicly\navailable professional ethical guidelines and offi-\ncial sample materials released by Australian reg-\nulatory bodies. No clinical records, therapy tran-\nscripts, or copyrighted assessment content are in-\ncluded. Benchmark questions are adapted from\npublic examples or synthetically generated under\ncontrolled prompts, and only the final questions\nand annotations are released.\n(ii) Human Subjects and Privacy. This work\ninvolved voluntary expert consultation with two\nclinically trained professionals, who provided in-\nformed consent to contribute in an advisory and\nannotation capacity to refine prompt formulations\nand evaluate the quality of LLM-generated outputs\nagainst predefined ethical criteria. No personal,\nsensitive, or patient-related data were provided at\nany stage. (iii) Intended Use. This benchmark\nis intended for research and evaluation purposes\nonly and is not designed for deployment in real-\nworld clinical decision-making. (iv) Responsible\nReporting. We report results to identify gaps in\nethical alignment rather than to rank models for\ndeployment, and encourage their use as diagnos-\ntic signals to guide future alignment research. (v)\nData and Code Availability. PsychEthicsBench,\nincluding all benchmark questions, prompts, and\nsource code for data curation, will be made fully\navailable upon publication. (vi) Use of AI Tools.\nIn preparing this manuscript, we used AI assistants,\nspecifically ChatGPT, for grammatical refinement\nand icon generation to improve the clarity and read-\nability. All scientific content, including the pipeline\ndesign, results analysis, and conclusions, was de-\nveloped solely by the authors.\nReferences\nAhpra. 2024.\nCode of conduct for psycholo-\ngists.\nhttps://www.ahpra.gov.au/documents/\ndefault.aspx?record=WD24%2F34313&dbid=\nAP&chksum=CNgh4pCJoskMdMaxBGVUkQ%3D%3D.\nAccessed: 2025-03-08.\nAnthropic. 2025.
