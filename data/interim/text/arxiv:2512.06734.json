Transfer Learning (TL) has accelerated the rapid development and \navailability of large language models (LLMs) for mainstream natural language \nprocessing (NLP) use cases. However, training and deploying such gigantic \nLLMs in resource‑constrained, real‑world healthcare situations remains \nchallenging. This study addresses the limited support available to visually \nimpaired users and speakers of low‑resource languages such as Hindi who require \nmedical assistance in rural environments. We propose PDFTEMRA (Performant \nDistilled Frequency Transformer Ensemble Model with Random Activations), a \ncompact transformer‑based architecture that integrates model distillation, \nfrequency‑domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized activation \npatterns to reduce computational cost while preserving language understanding \nperformance. The model is trained and evaluated on medical question‑answering \nand consultation datasets tailored to Hindi and accessibility scenarios, and its \nperformance is compared against standard NLP state-of-the-art model baselines. \nResults demonstrate that PDFTEMRA achieves comparable performance with \nsubstantially lower computational requirements, indicating its suitability for \naccessible, inclusive, low‑resource medical NLP applications. \n \nKeywords: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Accessible \nAI, Human-centered AI, NLP. \n1 \nIntroduction \nThis is the era of LLMs, such as BERT [1], BART [2], T5 [3], GPT2 [4], Bloom [5], \nLlama [6] and many more which are readily and easily accessible to everyone. Many of \nthese LLMs underlying use attention-based-transformers [8]. Transformers, have \nachieved great accomplishment in realizing AI and NLP based tasks. GPT2, a \ntransformer decoder-based-network turned out as few of highest cited research. \nAcademicians and researchers have strained to overcome restrictions of transformers \nby introducing finer improved networks. Majority work exploited similar time-domain \nimprovements and minimum use of forward-thinking scientific notions, such as, \n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "2 \nModulation [9], Frequency Domain Analysis [10], Fourier Transform [11] as in FNET \n[12] or Hartely Transform [13] to further heighten the network performance. Some \nresearchers tried concepts like distillation as anchored in DistilBERT [14] to improve \nnetwork efficiency utilizing Teacher-Student network to get similar performances of \nlarge models with smaller and smarter architectures. WISHPER [15], a multilingual \nspeech-to-text network predicts text transcripts based on 0.68 million hours of training \nand generalizes nicely on benchmarks. MMS [16], a transformer-based-speech-model \nscales to 1000+ languages and is built on wav2vec 2.0 base. M2M-VITS [17], with \nM2M100 baseline, is a multilingual transformer-based-network utilized in multilingual \ntransformations that can translate in 100 languages. However, these models are \nhumongous and cannot be trained from scratch owing to accompanying costs. Training \nthese models takes from many days to months on multiple GPUs together. However, to \nreduce this training time from scratch, techniques like, fine-tuning, quantization, \ncompression and adaptation are utilized. LORA [18], known as Low-Rank Adaptation \nis lightweight training procedure to lessen count of trainable parameters by introducing \na minor count of novel weights into the network and are trained to produce smaller \nmodel. Use of AdaNorm [19], in PDFTEMRA, an outperforming layer normalizing \ntechnique results faster and memory-efficient model architecture. \nActivations are useful in neural networks resulting smarter inferences. TanH, as \nutilized in LSTM [20] is chosen above sigmoid for superior non-linearity but suffers \nwith vanishing gradients that is better dealt by ReLU [21]. ReLUs, known as Rectified \nLinear Units are linear on non-negative measurements and 0 for negatives resulting \nimproved non-linear knowledge retention. ELU [22], known as Exponential Linear Unit \n(ELU) induces exponential activation learning that has negatives near to 0’s \nconsequential inferior computational complications. PreLU [23] activations have \nnegative values as well but they ensure lesser clatter deactivations. LeakyReLU [24], \nknown as Leaky Rectified Linear Unit is framed on ReLU adding shorter gradients for \nnon-positive values rather than flat gradients. SELU [25], known as Scaled Exponential \nLinear Unit encourage self-normalization. CELU [26] is good for raising deeper \nnetworks by quality of non-vanishing-gradients. MISH [27], is self-regularized non-\nmonotonic outperforms LeakyReLU on YOLOv4 [28] and ReLU on ResNet-50 [29]. \nSILU [30], known as Sigmoid Linear Unit is calculated with sigmoid increased with \ninputs. GELU [31], known as Gaussian Error Linear Unit is standard and smoother than \nReLU and utilized in BERT, GPT3 [32] and many other known transformers. \nEvaluation Metrics are used to validate our network performance. WER [33], \nknown as Word error rate metric validates speech recognition/translation \nperformance and ranges between 0 to 1, where 0 indicates exactly identical and 1 \nabsolutely dissimilar outcome. BLEU [34], known as Bilingual evaluation evaluates \nmachine-translated transcripts and claims higher relationship with human based \ndecisions. BLEU score ranges between 0 to 1, where values nearing 1 represent \nresemblances and 0 non-resemblances. \n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "3 \n1.1 \nHighlights  \nPurpose: The drive of this study is to develop and validate PDFTEMRA \n(Performant Distilled Frequency Transformer Ensemble Model with Random \nActivations), a compact transformer-based network engineered to offer accessible \nmedical natural language processing capabilities for visually impaired users and \nspeakers of low-resource languages like Hindi in resource-constrained rural \nhealthcare settings, while preserving performance analogous to state-of-the-art \nmodels but with significantly reduced computational necessities. \n \nContributions: PDFTEMRA solution contributions are discussed below: \n• PDFTEMRA Implementation – PDFTEMRA (Performant Distilled Frequency \nTransformer Ensemble Model with Random Activations) demonstrates successful \nuse of Transfer Learning (TL) on the custom medical dataset, PADT (PDFTEMRA \nDataset). \n• Instrumenting with Model Distillation (MD) – Model Distillation (MD) technique \nis grounded on Knowledge Distillation (KD) that replaces, Teacher with Distributor \n(D) and Student with Consumer (C) model. There could be multiple (Ds) based on \nthe needs and required tasks and (C) will mimic (D) based on task-in-hand. \nImplementation selects GPT2 as (D), to teach, PDFTEMRA as (C) model which \nachieve excellent results.  \n• Validate use of novel Layer Transformation Technique – This work, \ndemonstrates successful usage of Frequency Modulation techniques instead of \nAttention, via, Hartley transform to realize cheaper and faster inference. \n• Establish use of novel Efficient Normalization Technique – The network utilizes \nAdaNorm instead of the casual layer normalization that enhances our network \nperformance even further. \n• Demonstrate use of novel Activation Ensemble (AE) – Practice of Activation \nEnsemble (AE), built with the multiple smart activations act more efficiently and \nestablish as very performant layer using ELU, LeakyReLU, PReLU, ReLU, SELU, \nCELU, Mish, Tanh, SiLU, and GELU. \n• Demonstrate use of novel Network Ensemble (NE) for Implementation of \nPatient-Doctor-NLP-System – Network Ensemble (NE), utilizes multiple models \nby sandwiching together. This work creates WISPHER_PDFTEMRA_MMS_VITS \nensemble that is the combination of PRE-PROCESSOR_PROCESSOR_POST-\nPROCESSOR ensemble architecture, where, WISPHER is the PRE-PROCESSOR, \nPDFTEMRA is the PROCESSOR, MMS and VITS are the POST-PROCESSORs. \n• PADT (PDFTEMRA Dataset) – A custom high quality medical dataset, PADT \n(PDFTEMRA Dataset) is created for training and fine-tuning our PDFTEMRA \nnetwork to demonstrate successful implementation of Patient -Doctor-NLP-System. \n \nChallenges: Next challenges towards implementation of Patient-Doctor-NLP-System \nfor Hindi speaking least privileged or visually impaired audience are next stated below: \n• Motivational Encounter – Race towards capitalism, many are eager to contribute \ntowards expanses with huge financial gains. However, this work ideates to solve an \n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "4 \nissue that paralyzes a segment of our society and has huge impact. The \nimplementation goal is to help the less privileged and reduce social inequality by \nassisting blind or unschooled Hindi speaking patients seeking medicine support. \nDuring this research, it was understood that, less privileged are more often \nconcentrated towards rural areas and doctors in urban, probably, with reason to have \ngood lifestyle and ease of living in bigger cities. This gap is expanding day-by-day \nand hence the work tries to shrink this discontinuity. \n• Software and Hardware Limitation – The research had access to open-source \nsoftware resources and limited hardware as we lacked funding support. The open-\nsource models used were run on RTX 3070 8GB GPU, Intel 4.7 GHz 20 Core CPU \nand ram with 32 GB size. \n• Dataset Availability & Quality – The PADT dataset is baselined on freely available \ndatasets and web-scraped-data. Thus, the work suits academic inferences and not \nfully compatible with commercial product implementation. As there is a huge \ncommercial market, wherein, the work can be implemented and while suggest to the \nreaders is to strengthen the datasets with robust doctor-based-expert-opinions for \ncommercial product or solution implementations.  \n• Model Bias – The work utilizes open-source networks, for reference, Distributor \n(D), Pre-Processor and Post-Processor. Reader should know that these models may \nhave induced biases which might get passed-on to Consumer (C) model. Therefore, \nfor any commercial product or commercial solution implementation based on the \nresearch work, model biases should be handled effectively. \n \nFindings: The work demonstrates that PDFTEMRA achieves performance comparable \nto standard state-of-the-art NLP networks on medical question-answering and \nconsultation PADT dataset tailored to Hindi and accessibility scenarios, while requiring \nsubstantially lower computational resources. This indicates that the integration of \nmodel distillation, frequency-domain modulation, ensemble learning, and randomized \nactivation patterns successfully reduces computational cost without compromising \nlanguage understanding performance, making the model suitable for deployment in \nresource-constrained rural healthcare environments where visually impaired users and \nspeakers of low-resource languages require medical assistance. \nThe entire paper is divided into VI sections.
