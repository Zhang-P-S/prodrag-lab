As individuals increas-\ningly turn to online platforms for information, support, and self-\nassessment, the Web has become a critical medium for expanding\naccess to mental health care and advancing social good. Artificial\nintelligence (AI) plays a growing role in this shift: assisting indi-\nviduals understand their conditions [30, 36, 39], supporting coun-\nselors in developing treatment strategies [23, 34], and helping clin-\nicians in decision-making [35]. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) [11, 18] have been rapidly adopted across web-based men-\ntal health applications, due to their strong linguistic capabilities,\nbroad world knowledge, and ability to engage in natural, empa-\nthetic dialogue. Their potential impact is considerable: LLMs can\nprovide scalable, always-available guidance and reach populations\nthat traditional services often fail to serve.\nHowever, deploying LLMs in such sensitive, high-stakes settings\nrequires more than producing fluent responses or superficially ac-\ncurate predictions. Effective mental health support depends on trans-\nparent, coherent, and context-grounded reasoning that reflects how\nhuman clinicians interpret complex, subjective narratives. When\nLLMs misread user self-reports, rely on incomplete reasoning, or\naccept subjective statements as factual, they may exaggerate symp-\ntoms, provide misleading feedback, or inadvertently amplify users’\nanxiety [27]. At scale, these risks threaten public trust and can un-\ndermine the social-good promise of AI-enabled mental health sup-\nport systems. These risks underscore the urgent need for LLMs ca-\npable of responsible, clinically aligned reasoning rather than merely\ngenerating plausible answers [10, 17].\nRecent efforts [4, 8, 40], have begun exploring how LLMs can\nbetter support mental-health tasks. Such as, Psyche-R1 [4] jointly\nintegrates empathy, psychological knowledge, and chain-of-thought\nreasoning through a large-scale synthesis pipeline and hybrid GRPO-\nSFT training. Psy-Interpreter [8] enhances implicit mental-state in-\nference using expert-annotated scenarios and a trajectory-aware\nreinforcement learning framework that imitates clinician-like rea-\nsoning. PsychCounsel-Bench [40] assesses whether LLMs meet coun-\nseling knowledge standards, finding that only frontier models sur-\npass certification-level performance [31].\nDespite these advances, current methods still have important\nlimitations in both method design and evaluation as showin in Ta-\nble 1. Most existing approaches focus on emotional understanding,\nknowledge tests, or supervised reasoning tailored to a narrow set\nof tasks, without systematically modeling core stages of clinical\nreasoning. Yet effective mental-health support requires reasoning\nacross several interconnected processes: appraisal (recognizing\nmaladaptive thought patterns), diagnosis (identifying likely con-\nditions), intervention (selecting appropriate therapeutic strate-\ngies), abstraction (synthesizing structured evidence), and verifi-\ncation (detecting inaccurate or misleading mental-health informa-\ntion). Furthermore, existing methods focus primarily on task accu-\nracy while overlooking the quality and reliability of the reasoning\nprocess. Reliable mental-health support requires LLMs to produce\ntransparent, coherent, and context-grounded reasoning across sev-\neral key dimensions: reasoning conciseness (avoiding unneces-\nsary complexity or repetition), logical coherence (providing step-\nwise, case-specific justification), hallucination avoidance (not\nintroducing unsupported facts), task understanding (following\nthe intended objective without drift), and internal consistency\n(maintaining non-contradictory reasoning throughout). Address-\ning these aspects is essential for assessing and developing LLMs\nthat can perform the step-wise, integrative reasoning that under-\nlies appraisal, diagnosis, intervention, abstraction, and verification\nin real mental-health practice.\nTo fill this gap, we present MentraSuite1, a unified suite of bench-\nmarks, datasets, and models for advancing reliable mental-health\nreasoning. We introduce MentraBench, a comprehensive bench-\nmark that evaluates five essential aspects of clinical and counsel-\ning cognition: appraisal, diagnosis, intervention, abstraction, and\nverification. MentraBench spans six tasks and 13 datasets, built\nby refining existing resources and constructing new ones. Unlike\nprior benchmarks focused primarily on accuracy, MentraBench\nemphasizes the quality of reasoning trajectories, assessing five key\ndimensions: reasoning conciseness, logical coherence, hallucina-\ntion avoidance, task understanding, and internal consistency. We\nthen introduce Mindora, a post-trained model optimized for di-\nverse mental-health reasoning tasks and more reliable reasoning\nprocesses. Mindora adopts a novel hybrid supervised fine tuning-\nreinforcement learning (SFT–RL) training strategy with an LLM-\nbased inconsistency-detection reward that dynamically enforces\ninternal consistency while enhancing reasoning depth and gener-\nalization to unseen cases. To support Mindora’s training, we con-\nstruct high-quality reasoning data through a Reasoning Trajectory\nGeneration (RTG) strategy. RTG filters samples by difficulty and\napplies a structured rewriting procedure that produces concise, read-\nable, and well-balanced reasoning trajectories, directly mitigating\nissues such as over-elaboration and improving reasoning clarity.\n1The code and data are available in MentraSuite.\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nDiagnosis\nDetermine what mental condition is likely.\nIt's kinda always been an issue.

This dimension tar-\ngets fine-grained cognitive-pattern reasoning, requiring the model\nto recognize subtle distorted appraisal cues and distinguish among\nsimilar forms of maladaptive thinking. We instantiate this dimen-\nsion through the cognitive error identification task, evaluated us-\ning three high-quality datasets that span more than a dozen cognitive-\ndistortion categories. CognitiveReframing [28] combines simulated\nnegative thoughts from the Thought Records Dataset [2] and self-\nreports from the Mental Health America website2, with distortions\nannotated by 15 trained mental-health professionals. PatternRe-\nframe [15], constructed from PERSONA-CHAT personas [41], con-\ntains statements crafted to manifest specific distortions and labeled\nby five independent raters. Therapist Q&A [29], derived from real\ntherapist–client interactions in the Therapist Q&A corpus3, pro-\nvides naturally occurring distorted statements annotated by two\nclinical raters. These three datasets adopt slightly different tax-\nonomies of cognitive errors. In our prompt design, we follow each\ndataset’s original definitions and examples. The cognitive-error cat-\negories shared across all three datasets include: All-or-Nothing Think-\ning, Overgeneralization, Labeling, Fortune Telling, Mind Reading,\nShould Statements, and Personalization. Unique categories in Cog-\nnitiveReframing include: Emotional Reasoning, Comparing and De-\nspairing, Blaming, Negative Feeling or Emotion, Catastrophizing,\nand Discounting the Positive. Unique categories in PatternReframe\ninclude: Mental Filtering, Catastrophizing, and Discounting the Pos-\nitive. Unique categories in Therapist Q&A include: Emotional Rea-\nsoning, Mental Filtering, Magnification, and No Distortion.\n2.1.2\nDiagnosis: Mental-Condition Reasoning. The Diagnosis dimen-\nsion assesses an LLM’s ability to determine what mental condition\nis likely given a client’s textual expression. This type of reason-\ning requires the model to make calibrated, clinically aligned judg-\nments about potential psychological problems, distinguishing be-\ntween similar symptom presentations, avoiding overpathologizing,\nand assessing severity with nuance. We instantiate this dimension\n2https://screening.mhanational.org/\n3https://www.kaggle.com/arnmaud/therapist-qa\nthrough the mental health condition detection task, which eval-\nuates whether a model can identify and classify possible mental\nhealth issues from real-world social-media posts. To benchmark di-\nagnostic performance, we employ one depression-specific dataset,\nDepSign [22], and two multi-condition mental-health classification\ndatasets collected from different platforms: SWMH [12] from Red-\ndit and T-SID [12] from Twitter.\n2.1.3\nIntervention: Therapeutic-Action Reasoning. The Intervention\ndimension evaluates an LLM’s ability to determine what counsel-\ning action should be taken in response to a client’s situation. This\ndimension targets therapeutic-action reasoning, requiring the model\nto analyze the client’s presentation and select the intervention strat-\negy that is most contextually appropriate, rather than offering generic,\nmisplaced, or logically inconsistent responses. We instantiate this\ndimension through the counseling-strategy formulation task, cov-\nering thirteen commonly taught intervention types.4\nTo construct evaluation data, we use two high-quality counsel-\ning dialogue corpora. Client utterances are compressed into con-\ncise case summaries using GPT-4o prompts, and counselor utter-\nances are annotated to extract strategy labels as reference answers.\nAll constructed items are manually reviewed and verified by an\nexpert counselor with over ten years of clinical experience, result-\ning in the final [dataset]𝑀versions. PsyDTCorpus𝑀: Based on\nPsyDTCorpus [37], which contains 5,000 high-quality single-turn\ndialogues from SoulChatCorpus and 12 anonymized real counsel-\ning cases synthesized into multi-turn interactions. Due to its par-\ntially synthetic nature, this dataset is used to train Mindora but\nexcluded from benchmark evaluation. AnnoMI𝑀: Based on An-\nnoMI [34], constructed from authorized motivational interviewing\n(MI) demonstration videos sourced from YouTube and Vimeo, tran-\nscribed and curated into high-quality multi-turn counseling inter-\nactions.\n2.1.4\nMulti-step: Multi-Step Clinical Reasoning. The Multi-step di-\nmension assesses whether an LLM can perform multi-step clini-\ncal reasoning across appraisal, diagnosis, and intervention. Mod-\nels must integrate symptom interpretation, condition identifica-\ntion, treatment selection, and research-level analysis within a sin-\ngle pipeline, mirroring the sequential decision-making process of\nmental-health professionals. We instantiate this dimension through\na psychiatry QA task and evaluate it using four psychiatry-focused\ndatasets. MHQA [25] provides knowledge-intensive question-answer\npairs from 471k PubMed abstracts covering major mental-health\nconditions. From MedQA𝑒𝑛[13], MedMCQA [20], and PubMedQA [14],\nwe manually extracted psychiatric-related questions to form the\n[𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑡]𝑀version, ensuring that they test their diagnostic, inter-\nvention, and evidence-based reasoning abilities. Together, these\ndatasets comprehensively benchmark an LLM’s capacity for end-\nto-end, multi-step clinical reasoning grounded in both practice and\nresearch evidence.\n4The strategies include Clarification, Paraphrasing, Reflection of Feeling, Summariz-\ning, Questioning Skills, Immediacy, Use of Silence, Self-Disclosure, Confrontation, En-\ncouragement, Repetition, Interpretation, and Guidance.\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\n2.1.5\nAbstraction: Evidence-Based Reasoning. The Abstraction di-\nmension evaluates whether an LLM can determine what the ev-\nidence shows by interpreting and summarizing complex psychi-\natric research reports. This task targets free-text evidence reason-\ning, requiring models to process long, highly structured system-\natic review abstracts, extract key numerical and methodological\ninformation, and convert it into clinically meaningful conclusions,\nincluding effect direction and certainty levels. We instantiate this\ndimension through the Psychiatry Systematic Review Summariza-\ntion (PSRS) dataset. Each case in PSRS was manually curated from\nthe Cochrane Library [26] to cover a broad spectrum of psychiatric\nconditions, populations, and intervention types, and expert anno-\ntators generated scoring points for every instance to capture the\nmain findings.\nIn this task, LLMs are required to summarize the main results\nreported in the studies—turning quantitative outcomes, confidence\nintervals, and methodological notes into concise, interpretable con-\nclusions. This involves synthesizing statistical evidence into clini-\ncal interpretation, inferring effect direction, and assessing the cer-\ntainty of evidence, rather than merely reproducing numerical re-\nsults. All abstracts are publicly available and retain study identi-\nfiers to ensure traceability; no patient-level or individual trial data\nare included.\n2.1.6\nVerification: Misinformation Detection. The Verification di-\nmension evaluates whether an LLM can determine whether mental-\nhealth information is accurate. This task targets misinformation de-\ntection reasoning, requiring models to identify misleading, anecdo-\ntal, or non-evidence-based claims in user-generated content while\nrelying on authoritative clinical knowledge. We instantiate this di-\nmension through the Mental Health Misinformation Identification\ntask, where models must distinguish reliable mental-health infor-\nmation from potentially harmful narratives in textual scripts de-\nrived from social-media videos.\nWe evaluate this task using the MentalMisinfo dataset [16], which\ncontains video content from platforms such as YouTube Shorts and\nBitChute. The materials were systematically filtered, transcribed,\nand manually annotated to indicate whether each statement is ac-\ncurate or misleading. By including this task, our benchmark as-\nsesses an LLM’s ability to perform evidence-based verification un-\nder real-world, noisy, and informal language conditions commonly\nencountered in online mental-health discourse.\n2.2\nMindora\nTo enable more reliable and clinically aligned mental-health rea-\nsoning, we propose Mindora, a post-trained large language model\ndesigned to improve both reasoning depth and reasoning fidelity.\nMindora builds on a hybrid SFT–RL training framework that inte-\ngrates high-quality reasoning trajectories with reinforcement sig-\nnals targeting consistency.\n2.2.1\nReasoning Trajectory Generation. To support Mindora’s train-\ning with high-quality supervision signals, we propose a reason-\ning trajectory generation strategy that focuses on genuinely chal-\nlenging reasoning steps rather than trivial pattern completion. Al-\nthough the tasks and datasets described above are demonstrably\nreasoning-intensive, directly using all training samples would di-\nlute the supervision with many instances that models can already\nsolve through surface-level cues. To obtain training data with suf-\nficient difficulty, we perform zero-shot question answering on the\ntraining split using Llama-3-8B-Instruct and retain only the cases\nwhere the model produces incorrect answers. This filtering proce-\ndure ensures that the collected trajectories focus on problems that\nrequire deeper reasoning and are more informative for model train-\ning. The number of retained training cases is shown in Table 2.\nTo address the readability and structural incoherence of reason-\ning trajectories caused by backtracking in iterative search, we pro-\npose a structured reasoning trajectory generation method inspired\nby the search-based complex reasoning framework [3]. The core\nworkflow involves two key stages: iterative optimal path search\nguided by a verifier and structured formatting of the optimal tra-\njectory, ensuring both reasoning depth and interpretability.\n2.2.2\nIterative Optimal Reasoning Path Search. We first leverage\nGPT-4o to explore and refine reasoning trajectories for verifiable\nmental health problems, following a feedback-driven iterative search\nparadigm:\nReasoning Generation. For a given verifiable problem 𝑥with\nground-truth answer 𝑦∗, GPT-4o generates an initial Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT), denoted as 𝑒0, and preliminary answer 𝑦0 by analyzing the\ncase context and applying domain knowledge.\nVerifier-Guided Refinement. A medical verifier implemented us-\ning GPT-4o checks if 𝑦0 aligns with 𝑦∗. If the verification returns\nFalse, GPT-4o samples a search strategy to refine the trajectory:\n(1) Backtracking: Revisits earlier reasoning steps 𝑒𝑗(𝑗< 𝑖−1) to\nidentify and resolve logical flaws. (2) Exploring New Paths: Devel-\nops an alternative reasoning approach distinct from prior attempts\n𝑒0, ..., 𝑒𝑖−1. (3) Verification: Validates the logical consistency and fac-\ntual accuracy of the current trajectory 𝑒𝑖−1.

This aims to avoiding inconsistencies, such\nas a conclusion favoring Major Depressive Disorder while the an-\nswer lists Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This alignment is crucial\nfor training models to produce logically grounded outputs in mental-\nhealth tasks, where misalignment could lead to clinical misjudg-\nments.\nImproving Interpretability. Structured subtitles (e.g., ###Differ-\nential Diagnosis Exclusion) teach the model to decompose complex\nmental health judgments into domain-specific sub-tasks—mirroring\nhow clinicians systematically analyze cases. This modular learning\nimproves the model’s ability to replicate interpretable, professional\nreasoning patterns.\n2.2.5\nTraining Procedure. The training of the mental health rea-\nsoning model adheres to the CHORD [42] algorithm’s core para-\ndigm of dynamic balancing between sft and rl exploration, with\na formalized reward mechanism to ensure the quality and valid-\nity of model outputs. The training framework integrates dual data\nstreams, adaptive weight scheduling, and a multi-criteria reward\nfunction, as formally detailed below.\nTraining Framework and Notations. Let ℳdenote the base\nmodel (Qwen3-8B), ℳaux represent the auxiliary model (Qwen3-\n32B) for internal consistency detection, and 𝒟SFT ⊂𝒳× 𝒴denote\nthe expert SFT dataset where 𝒳is the set of mental health reason-\ning prompts and 𝒴is the set of expert solutions. Let 𝒟RL ⊂𝒳× 𝒴\nbe the RL exploration dataset generated by ℳduring rollout. The\ntraining objective is to optimize the policy 𝜋𝜃(parameterized by 𝜃)\nvia the CHORD algorithm, which dynamically fuses SFT loss ℒSFT\nand RL loss ℒRL using two-level weights: global weight 𝜇(𝑡) and\ntoken-level weight 𝜙(⋅).\nThe reward 𝑟(𝑠, 𝑎) for an action 𝑎(model solution) given a state\n𝑠(input prompt) is a composite function consisting of four sequen-\ntial validity and quality checks, formally defined as:\n𝑟(𝑠, 𝑎) = 𝕀(FormatValid(𝑎)) ⋅𝕀(LengthValid(𝑎)) ⋅𝕀(Consistency(𝑎)) ⋅𝑄Quality(𝑎)\n(1)\nwhere: 𝕀(⋅) is the indicator function (1 if the condition holds, 0\notherwise). In detail, FormatValid(𝑎) verifies if 𝑎adheres to the\nmandatory format <think>...</think><answer>...</answer>.\nLengthValid(𝑎) ensures the token length of the inner thinking tra-\njectory 𝒯in 𝑎falls within a valid range [𝐿min, 𝐿max], where 𝐿min =\n10 tokens and 𝐿max = 2048 tokens. Consistency(𝑎) detects factual\ninconsistencies or errors in 𝒯using the auxiliary model ℳaux.\n𝑄Quality(𝑎) quantifies the correctness of 𝑎based on task-specific\nbenchmark criteria, with values in [0, 1]. It is defined separately\nfor three task types:\n(1) Single-choice questions: Let 𝑦∗be the ground-truth answer.\nThen:\n𝑄Quality(𝑎) = {1\nif the final conclusion in 𝒯= 𝑦∗,\n0\notherwise.\n(2)\n(2) Multiple-choice questions: Let 𝑌∗= {𝑦∗1 , 𝑦∗2 , ..., 𝑦∗\n𝑘} be the\nset of ground-truth answers, and 𝑌= {𝑦1, 𝑦2, ..., 𝑦𝑚} be the set of\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nanswers in 𝒯. The quality score is the Jaccard similarity between\n𝑌and 𝑌∗:\n𝑄Quality(𝑎) = |𝑌∩𝑌∗|\n|𝑌∪𝑌∗| .\n(3)\n(3) Short-answer questions: Let 𝒦= {𝑘1, 𝑘2, ..., 𝑘𝑛} be the set of\nkey scoring points for the task, and 𝒦hit ⊆𝒦be the subset of\npoints covered in 𝒯. Then:\n𝑄Quality(𝑎) = |𝒦hit|\n|𝒦| .\n(4)\nTraining Pipeline. The training process proceeds in iterations 𝑡=\n1, 2, ..., 𝑇max (where 𝑇max is the total number of training steps), with\neach iteration consisting of data sampling, weight scheduling, loss\ncomputation, and parameter update stages.\nStep 1: Data Sampling. At each step 𝑡, we sample two mini-batches:\nAn SFT mini-batch ℬSFT ∼𝒟SFT with batch size 𝐵SFT = 64 (con-\nsistent with the experimental setup), where each sample is (𝑥𝑖, 𝑦∗\n𝑖) ∈\n𝒳×𝒴( 𝑥𝑖is the prompt, 𝑦∗\n𝑖is the expert solution). An RL mini-batch\nℬRL ∼𝒟RL with dynamic batch size 𝐵RL, where each sample is\n(𝑥𝑗, 𝑎𝑗) ∈𝒳× 𝒴( 𝑎𝑗is the model-generated solution via rollout).\nThe rollout for 𝒟RL generation uses a temperature 𝜏= 1.0, with\n𝐾= 8 candidate solutions sampled per prompt.\nStep 2: Adaptive Weight Scheduling. The global weight 𝜇(𝑡)\n(balancing ℒSFT and ℒRL) follows a warmup-decay schedule to\ntransition from expert imitation to RL exploration:\n(1) Warmup phase (1 ≤𝑡≤𝑡warmup, 𝑡warmup = 200 steps):\n𝜇(𝑡) = 𝜇valley + (𝜇peak −𝜇valley) ⋅\n𝑡\n𝑡warmup\n,\n(5)\nwhere 𝜇peak = 0.5 (maximum SFT influence) and 𝜇valley = 0.02\n(minimum SFT influence).\n(2) Decay phase (𝑡warmup < 𝑡≤𝑡warmup + 𝑡decay, 𝑡decay = 400\nsteps):\n𝜇(𝑡) = 𝜇peak −(𝜇peak −𝜇valley) ⋅\n𝑡−𝑡warmup\n𝑡decay\n.\n(6)\nThe token-wise weight 𝜙(𝑦∗𝑡; 𝜋𝜃) (for SFT loss modulation) is\ndefined based on the policy’s probability of generating the expert\ntoken 𝑦∗𝑡(given prompt 𝑥and prefix 𝑦∗<𝑡):\n𝜙(𝑦∗𝑡; 𝜋𝜃) = 𝑝𝑡(1 −𝑝𝑡),\n(7)\nwhere 𝑝𝑡= 𝜋𝜃(𝑦∗𝑡|𝑥, 𝑦∗<𝑡). This parabolic function prioritizes learn-\ning for tokens where the policy is uncertain ( 𝑝𝑡≈0.5 ) while\ndownweighting certain ( 𝑝𝑡≈1 ) or irrelevant ( 𝑝𝑡≈0 ) tokens.\nStep 3: Loss Computation and Parameter Update. The total\nloss ℒtotal(𝜃) is a weighted combination of the SFT loss (with token-\nwise weighting) and the RL loss:\nℒtotal(𝜃) = (1 −𝜇(𝑡)) ⋅ℒGRPO(𝜃) + 𝜇(𝑡) ⋅ℒSFT−𝜙(𝜃),\n(8)\nSFT loss with token-wise weighting ℒSFT−𝜙(𝜃) is computed over\nℬSFT, minimizing the weighted negative log-likelihood of expert\nsolutions:\nℒSFT−𝜙(𝜃)\n= −\n1\n∑(𝑥𝑖,𝑦∗𝑖)∈ℬSFT |𝑦∗𝑖|\n∑\n(𝑥𝑖,𝑦∗𝑖)∈ℬSFT\n|𝑦∗𝑖|\n∑\n𝑡=1\n𝜙(𝑦∗𝑖,𝑡; 𝜋𝜃) ⋅log 𝜋𝜃(𝑦∗𝑖,𝑡|𝑥𝑖, 𝑦∗𝑖,<𝑡).\n(9)\nGRPO loss ℒGRPO(𝜃) is optimized over ℬRL to maximize the\nexpected reward, using a clipped surrogate objective (consistent\nwith PPO-style updates):\nℒGRPO(𝜃)\n= −\n1\n∑(𝑥𝑗,𝑎𝑗)∈ℬRL |𝑎𝑗|\n∑\n(𝑥𝑗,𝑎𝑗)∈ℬRL\n|𝑎𝑗|\n∑\n𝑡=1\nmin (𝑟𝑗,𝑡(𝜃)𝐴𝑗, clip(𝑟𝑗,𝑡(𝜃), 1 −𝜖, 1 + 𝜖)𝐴𝑗) ,\n(10)\nwhere: 𝑟𝑗,𝑡(𝜃) =\n𝜋𝜃(𝑎𝑗,𝑡|𝑥𝑗,𝑎𝑗,<𝑡)\n𝜋sample(𝑎𝑗,𝑡|𝑥𝑗,𝑎𝑗,<𝑡) (importance sampling ratio, 𝜋sample\nis the reference policy), 𝐴𝑗= 𝑟(𝑥𝑗,𝑎𝑗)−𝜇𝑅\n𝜎𝑅+𝜖𝑧\n(normalized advantage,\n𝜇𝑅/𝜎𝑅are the mean/std of rewards in the rollout group, 𝜖𝑧= 10−8\nfor stability), 𝜖= 0.2. The policy parameters 𝜃are updated by\nminimizing ℒtotal(𝜃) using the Adam optimizer with 𝛽1 = 0.9,\n𝛽2 = 0.999, and learning rate 𝜂= 2×10−6. Training checkpointing\nis performed every 10 steps to preserve intermediate model states.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nExperimental Settings\nEvaluated LLMs. To assess whether model scale, distilled rea-\nsoning variants, and the gap between reasoning-oriented and chat-\noriented LLMs affect performance on mental health reasoning tasks,\nwe evaluated a broad range of GPT, DeepSeek, Qwen, and LLaMA\nmodels. For closed-source systems, we included the reasoning mod-\nels GPT-o (o4-mini), DeepSeek-R (DeepSeek-R1), and Qwen’s QwQ\nseries (QwQ-plus), as well as the leading chat models GPT-4o, DeepSeek-\nV3, and Qwen-plus5. For open-source models, we tested Qwen,\nLLaMA, and DeepSeek-distilled variants across multiple scales, with\nthe full list provided in Table 3. For psychology-focused LLMs, we\nevaluated EmoLLM6 , finetuned from Qwen2-7B-Instruct as a well-\nknown mental-health chat model, and Psyche-R17 , an SFT+GRPO-\ntrained Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model representing the latest mental-\nhealth-reasoning LLMs.\nEvaluation Settings. All closed-source LLMs are accessed through\ntheir official APIs, while open-source models are deployed on a sin-\ngle NVIDIA A800-SXM4-80GB GPU. Parameters such as tempera-\nture are kept at their default values. Prompts are aligned with the\nMindora format to generate structured reasoning chains for con-\nsistent comparison.\n3.2\nMain Results\nIn this benchmark, we evaluate the reasoning performance of vari-\nous models across 13 datasets covering five core aspects of mental-\nhealth practice. The results, presented in Table 3, highlight several\nkey findings.\nIn general, Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷achieves the highest average score\nacross all datasets, followed by Mindora𝑆𝐹𝑇+ 𝑅𝐿, both surpass-\ning leading proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-o4-mini and\nDeepSeek-R1. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our post-training\nstrategy in enhancing reasoning performance within complex, context-\nsensitive mental-health tasks. Across every dataset, Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷\noutperform the backbone model Qwen3-8B, showing consistent\ngains in both accuracy and reasoning quality. Furthermore, Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷\nalso exceeds the separately trained Mindora𝑆𝐹𝑇and Mindora𝑆𝐹𝑇+𝑅𝐿\nvariants, confirming that the joint SFT–RL training paradigm more\neffectively balances imitation and exploration, avoiding overfitting\nwhile improving generalization to unseen cases.\nPerformance analysis across the five task categories reveals that\nMindoraCHORD demonstrates strong appraisal and diagnostic rea-\nsoning, showing improved recognition of subtle cognitive patterns\nand accurate differentiation of overlapping symptom presentations.\n5Qwen-plus is Qwen’s versatile chat model, also trained with reasoning capabilities.\n6https://www.modelscope.cn/models/aJupyter/EmoLLM_Qwen2-7B-Instruct_lora/.\n7https://huggingface.co/MindIntLab/Psyche-R1\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nMengxi Xiao et al.\nIt also achieves notable gains in intervention and abstraction tasks,\nreflecting enhanced multi-stage reasoning and evidence synthesis.\nThe model’s consistent results in verification tasks further suggest\nreliable factual grounding and resistance to misinformation.\nWe also observe several interesting phenomena. Among open-\nsource LLMs, different versions of the same model (e.g., DSDistill-\nQwen3-32B, Qwen3-32B, and QwQ-32B) show only minor differ-\nences in overall reasoning performance, regardless of whether they\nare distilled, chat, or reasoning variants. This suggests that mental-\nhealth reasoning tasks demand specialized reasoning abilities that\ngeneral-purpose post-training cannot fully capture, underscoring\nthe need for targeted reasoning optimization for mental health sce-\nnarios. Moreover, we find that open-source models ranging from\n14B to 70B parameters achieve similar average scores around 0.6,\nwhile 8B-scale models remain near 0.55. In contrast, our Mindora\nseries and the baseline Psyche-R1, both specifically optimized for\nmental-health reasoning, exceed the average performance of 8B\nmodels, demonstrating the strong potential of targeted post-training\nin this domain.\n3.3\nReasoning Trajectory Evaluation\nIn this section, we evaluate the reasoning trajectory quality of best\nperforming models in MentraBench from each major family (GPT,\nDeepSeek, Qwen, and LLaMA), the mental-health-oriented Psyche-\nR1, our backbone Qwen3-8B, and our proposed Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷.\nTo assess reasoning quality beyond task accuracy, we conduct a\ndetailed reasoning trajectory evaluation based on five criteria: rea-\nsoning conciseness, logical coherence, hallucination, task under-\nstanding, and internal consistency. Each reasoning chain is manu-\nally evaluated following a binary guideline, where a score of 1 is\nassigned if no errors are observed and 0 otherwise, with detailed\nscoring criteria shown in Appendix A. The final reasoning trajec-\ntory score is computed as the average across all five dimensions,\nproviding a comprehensive measure of reasoning reliability and\ntransparency in mental-health tasks.\nFor each model and each dataset, we sample four representa-\ntive cases, two where all models produce correct answers and two\nwhere all models fail, to ensure fairness in comparison.\nTable 4 shows that Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷achieves remarkable aver-\nage trajectory score, demonstrating balanced performance across\nmultiple evaluation dimensions. Through refined training and bal-\nanced optimization, our model attains the best overall correctness\nand interpretability, highlighting its strength in both reasoning ac-\ncuracy and clarity.\nFor redundancy and backtracking related dimensions, Mindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷\nshows substantial improvement over the backbone model Qwen3-\n8B. This confirms the effectiveness of the structured trajectory gen-\neration step in our training data, which enables the model to pro-\nduce reasoning chains that are more organized, concise, and logi-\ncally coherent.\n3.4\nCase Study\nIn this section, we analyze a challenging case of cognitive error\nidentification shown in Appendix Figure 3, where all compared\nmodels produced incorrect answers. In this case, the client expresses\nthe thought Am I insane? after experiencing the situation of feel-\ning watched by others. The correct reasoning requires recognizing\nthat the cognitive error lies in the thought itself, specifically, la-\nbeling, as the client directly labels themselves as insane. However,\nmost models mistakenly focused on the situation rather than the\nthought, interpreting the error as treating feelings as facts due to\nthe client’s perception of being watched. Only our model correctly\nconcentrated on the thought itself, avoiding confusion between the\nexternal situation and the internal self-labeling process.\n4\nRelated Work\nRecent efforts have begun to explore psychological reasoning and\ncounseling intelligence in LLMs. Psyche-R1 [4] represents a ma-\njor step toward domain-specific psychological LLMs that combine\nempathy, expertise, and reasoning. It introduces a synthetic bench-\nmark and a hybrid training pipeline that mixes supervised fine-\ntuning on easier samples with reinforcement learning on filtered\nhard cases, improving interpretive reasoning and emotional under-\nstanding. Psy-Interpreter [8] further advances psychological and\nsocial-cognitive reasoning through the StimuliQA dataset, composed\nof expert-annotated narrative stimuli capturing emotions and col-\nlective cognition. Its bilateral reinforcement-learning design aligns\nmodel trajectories with expert reasoning patterns, enhancing inter-\npretive and social-cognitive generalization. PsychCounsel-Bench\n[40] complements these modeling efforts by constructing a 2,200-\nquestion benchmark derived from counselor-certification exams\ncovering counseling methods, abnormal and developmental psy-\nchology, and ethics. Evaluations on leading models (e.g., GPT-4o,\nLlama 3.3-70B, Gemma 3-27B) suggest that current LLMs can al-\nready master exam-level psychological knowledge. Despite their\ncontributions, existing works largely emphasize emotional under-\nstanding, social inference, or theoretical knowledge, leaving deeper\nreasoning processes underexplored. Psyche-R1 and Psy-Interpreter\nenhance empathy and emotion-related reasoning but do not assess\nmulti-stage chains that integrate appraisal, diagnosis, and interven-\ntion. PsychCounsel-Bench evaluates professional knowledge but\nis limited to exam-style multiple-choice questions, testing recall\nrather than open-ended, context-dependent reasoning. As a result,\nkey abilities:such as synthesizing conflicting evidence, distinguish-\ning overlapping symptoms, generating context-appropriate inter-\nventions, and verifying factual accuracy, remain unmeasured.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we introduced MentraSuite, comprising the Mentra-\nBench benchmark and the Mindora model, to systematically ad-\nvance and evaluate mental-health reasoning. Unlike prior studies\nthat focus primarily on emotional understanding or knowledge-\nbased assessment, our benchmark targets five clinically grounded\nreasoning aspects to capture the multi-stage and context-sensitive\nnature of real mental-health practice: appraisal, diagnosis, inter-\nvention, abstraction, and verification. We further developed a struc-\ntured Reasoning Trajectory Generation method and the post-trained\nmodel Mindora, which integrates supervised fine-tuning and re-\ninforcement learning with consistency-aware reward design. Ex-\nperimental results demonstrate that Mindora’s overall reasoning\nperformance surpasses strong baselines such as GPT-4o-mini and\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "MentraSuite: Post-Training Large Language Models for Mental Health Reasoning and Assessment\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nTable 3: Experimental results on MentraBench.\nModel\nCognitiveReframing\nPatternReframe\nTherapist Q&A\n𝐴𝑣𝑔1\nDepSign\nSWMH\nT-SID\n𝐴𝑣𝑔2\nAnnoMI𝑀\nMHQA\nMedQA𝑀\nMedMCQA𝑀\nPubMedQA𝑀\n𝐴𝑣𝑔4\nPSRS\nMentalMisinfo\n𝐴𝑣𝑔𝑎𝑙𝑙\nclose-source models\nGPT-o4-mini[19]\n0.7002\n0.6607\n0.4468\n0.6026\n0.3607\n0.7374\n0.7515\n0.6165\n0.2086\n0.5462\n0.8925\n0.8102\n0.7118\n0.7402\n0.8650\n0.7781\n0.6515\nGPT-4o[18]\n0.6791\n0.6667\n0.4543\n0.6000\n0.4064\n0.7500\n0.7114\n0.6226\n0.3358\n0.4531\n0.6138\n0.7936\n0.6949\n0.6389\n0.9065\n0.6894\n0.6273\nDeepseek-R1[6]\n0.7516\n0.7069\n0.4472\n0.6352\n0.4085\n0.7624\n0.7218\n0.6309\n0.2020\n0.4984\n0.8608\n0.8988\n0.7256\n0.7459\n0.9037\n0.5689\n0.6505\nDeepseek-V3[7]\n0.6540\n0.6755\n0.4131\n0.5809\n0.4211\n0.7715\n0.7581\n0.6502\n0.2140\n0.4768\n0.8184\n0.8696\n0.6848\n0.7124\n0.9296\n0.6156\n0.6386\nQwen-plus[38]\n0.6821\n0.6395\n0.4057\n0.5758\n0.4043\n0.7624\n0.7662\n0.6443\n0.1866\n0.4795\n0.8242\n0.8895\n0.7199\n0.7283\n0.9048\n0.6018\n0.6387\nQwQ-plus[24]\n0.6698\n0.6871\n0.3698\n0.5756\n0.4085\n0.7547\n0.7330\n0.6321\n0.1848\n0.4201\n0.6405\n0.8354\n0.7226\n0.6546\n0.9335\n0.4838\n0.6034\n70B+ open-source models\nLLaMA-4[1]\n0.6588\n0.6486\n0.4031\n0.5702\n0.3914\n0.7310\n0.7884\n0.6369\n0.2066\n0.4684\n0.7414\n0.8900\n0.7239\n0.7059\n0.7634\n0.6158\n0.6178\nLLaMA-3.3-70B[11]\n0.6444\n0.6301\n0.3566\n0.5437\n0.4148\n0.7163\n0.7157\n0.6156\n0.2023\n0.4148\n0.7712\n0.8904\n0.7299\n0.7016\n0.6318\n0.6894\n0.6006\ndsdistill-LLaMA-70B[6]\n0.6667\n0.6667\n0.3905\n0.5746\n0.4000\n0.7516\n0.6953\n0.6156\n0.2367\n0.4404\n0.7097\n0.7957\n0.7452\n0.6727\n0.8914\n0.6814\n0.6209\nQwen2.5-72B[24]\n0.6852\n0.6207\n0.3930\n0.5663\n0.3806\n0.7639\n0.8136\n0.6527\n0.2796\n0.4022\n0.7449\n0.8402\n0.7229\n0.6775\n0.9555\n0.6091\n0.6316\n32B open-source models\ndsdistill-Qwen32B[6]\n0.6540\n0.6696\n0.3539\n0.5592\n0.3979\n0.7358\n0.7373\n0.6237\n0.2178\n0.4010\n0.6697\n0.7795\n0.7229\n0.6433\n0.9225\n0.6177\n0.6061\nQwen3-32B[38]\n0.6247\n0.6395\n0.4255\n0.5632\n0.3806\n0.7685\n0.8038\n0.6510\n0.2016\n0.4355\n0.7415\n0.8206\n0.7083\n0.6765\n0.9333\n0.5025\n0.6143\nQwQ-32B[24]\n0.6791\n0.6842\n0.3905\n0.5846\n0.4085\n0.7500\n0.7296\n0.6294\n0.1749\n0.4305\n0.6831\n0.8470\n0.7375\n0.6745\n0.9296\n0.4642\n0.6084\n14B open-source models\ndsdistill-Qwen14B[6]\n0.6635\n0.5981\n0.3404\n0.5340\n0.4169\n0.7421\n0.7750\n0.6447\n0.2470\n0.3823\n0.6198\n0.6660\n0.7497\n0.6045\n0.8641\n0.5795\n0.5880\nQwen3-14B[38]\n0.6540\n0.6486\n0.4820\n0.5949\n0.3871\n0.7484\n0.7540\n0.6298\n0.1680\n0.4215\n0.7047\n0.8102\n0.6882\n0.6562\n0.8155\n0.6600\n0.6109\n7∼8B open-source models\nLLaMA3.1-8B[11]\n0.5871\n0.5714\n0.1957\n0.4514\n0.4476\n0.7358\n0.7581\n0.6472\n0.2147\n0.2771\n0.5791\n0.7925\n0.7096\n0.5896\n0.6805\n0.6703\n0.5553\ndsdistill-LLaMA-8B[6]\n0.5906\n0.5507\n0.2396\n0.4603\n0.4190\n0.7294\n0.7490\n0.6325\n0.2001\n0.3321\n0.4430\n0.6070\n0.7587\n0.5352\n0.8157\n0.7617\n0.5536\nEmoLLM[32]\n0.6180\n0.5472\n0.3322\n0.4991\n0.4334\n0.7229\n0.7931\n0.6498\n0.1408\n0.3373\n0.4311\n0.5749\n0.6735\n0.5042\n0.7906\n0.6346\n0.5407\nPsyche-R1[5]\n0.5013\n0.5222\n0.2021\n0.4085\n0.4169\n0.6877\n0.7962\n0.6336\n0.2424\n0.5872\n0.6989\n0.8401\n0.7194\n0.7114\n0.8164\n0.6954\n0.5943\nQwen3-8B[38]\n0.5941\n0.6395\n0.4057\n0.5464\n0.4169\n0.7358\n0.7515\n0.6347\n0.1489\n0.4009\n0.5824\n0.7927\n0.6899\n0.6165\n0.8115\n0.4773\n0.5729\nMindora𝑆𝐹𝑇\n0.5693\n0.6207\n0.4472\n0.5457\n0.4887\n0.7437\n0.7597\n0.6640\n0.4193\n0.5830\n0.7263\n0.8535\n0.7376\n0.7251\n0.7764\n0.5512\n0.6367\nMindora𝑆𝐹𝑇+𝑅𝐿\n0.5975\n0.6207\n0.4566\n0.5583\n0.5240\n0.7715\n0.8140\n0.7032\n0.3803\n0.5996\n0.7839\n0.8593\n0.8212\n0.7660\n0.7159\n0.5681\n0.6548\nMindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷\n0.7293\n0.6842\n0.5088\n0.6408\n0.4655\n0.7760\n0.8030\n0.6815\n0.4016\n0.6317\n0.7590\n0.8535\n0.8442\n0.7721\n0.8379\n0.7178\n0.6933\nTable 4: Reasoning trajectory evaluation.\nModel\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR𝑎𝑣𝑔\nAnnotation Scores\nGPT-o4-mini\n1.0000\n0.4135\n1.0000\n0.9519\n1.0000\n0.8731\nDeepseek-R1\n0.9519\n0.9808\n1.0000\n0.9808\n1.0000\n0.9827\nQwen-plus\n0.6538\n1.0000\n1.0000\n0.9808\n1.0000\n0.9270\nLLaMA-4\n1.0000\n0.2596\n1.0000\n0.8942\n0.9423\n0.8192\nPsyche-R1\n0.9423\n0.9038\n1.0000\n0.9712\n0.9038\n0.9442\nQwen3-8B\n0.5769\n0.9712\n1.0000\n0.9808\n0.9904\n0.9039\nMindora𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑅𝐷\n0.9423\n0.9519\n1.0000\n0.9904\n0.9808\n0.9731\nInner-Annotator Agreement\nGwet AC1\n0.9607\n0.8918\n1.0000\n0.9705\n0.9855\n0.9617\nCohen’s Kappa\n0.8692\n0.7906\n1.0000\n0.6033\n0.7298\n0.7986\nConsistency\n0.9698\n0.9286\n1.0000\n0.9725\n0.9863\n0.9714\nNote: R1: Reasoning Conciseness;

When some things really don't work(for example I have some things for school for tommorow and I can't find how to do that thing after searching hours on \ninternet I get angry and sometimes results to self harm(punching). I sometimes feel like everybody is here just to watch me and see how I react to things(sounds insane).\nThought: Am I insane?\nQ: The most likely cognitive error is?\nCognitiveReframing\nKey Analysis: The client believes others are judging them and feels watched, indicating a distorted belief about others' \nperceptions. \nStep Reasoning: \nThe client assumes others know their thoughts (mind reading). \nFeeling judged without evidence aligns with mind reading. \nSelf-harm stems from distress, not the primary cognitive error. \nFinal Answer: Answer: [Mind reading]\nQwen3-8B\n1. Key Analysis: The client believes others can hear/assess their thoughts and judge them, and feels observed, indicating an \nassumption about others' perceptions without evidence. \n2. Step Reasoning: \nPrimary distortion involves assuming others’ internal states (thoughts/judgments). \nDirectly aligns with \"Mind reading\": attributing unverified mental states to others. \nOther errors (e.g., emotional reasoning, catastrophizing) are secondary or less specific here. \n3. Final Answer: Answer: [Mind reading]\nQwen-plus\n1.\"In class I feel like others hear my thoughts and judge me.\": This is a classic example of Mind Reading. The client is \nassuming they know what others are thinking (\"judge me\") and even attributing impossible knowledge to them (\"hear my \nthoughts\") without evidence.\n2.\"I sometimes feel like everybody is here just to watch me and see how I react to things\": This reinforces the Mind \nReading error. The client assumes they know the intentions and focus of others (\"everybody is here just to watch me\"), \nbelieving everyone is paying specific, judgmental attention to them without proof.\n3.\"(sounds insane)\" / \"Am I insane?\": The client's awareness that this belief sounds irrational highlights the distorted nature \nof this thinking pattern, which is characteristic of cognitive errors like Mind Reading.\nWhile other errors might be present (like Emotional Reasoning - feeling judged must mean it's true, or Personalization - \ntaking others' presence/actions personally as being \"about\" them), the core distortion driving the distress described in the \nquery is the persistent assumption of knowing others' thoughts and intentions (Mind Reading).\nAnswer: Mind reading\nDeepseek-R1\n###Understanding the Thought Process: \nThe client is questioning their own sanity, indicating a focus on their internal feelings and perceptions.\n###Evaluating Emotional Influence: \nThe client's feelings of being judged and overwhelmed by thoughts suggest they might be treating these emotions as factual \nevidence of insanity.\n###Assessing Emotional Reasoning: \nThe client's thought process reflects a tendency to accept their emotions as truth, indicating emotional reasoning.\n###Final Conclusion: \nThe cognitive error most applicable to the client's thought process is 'Emotional Reasoning', where they treat their feelings \nas facts about their sanity.\ngenerated_answer:\n Answer: emotional reasoning\nMindora\n1. Key Analysis:  \nThe client assumes others know and judge their thoughts, feeling constantly observed and evaluated.\n2. Step Reasoning:  \n• Client believes they can read others’ minds (“others hear my thoughts and judge me”)  \n• They infer judgment without evidence, fitting the definition of mind reading  \n3. Final Answer:  \nAnswer: Mind reading\nGPT-o4-mini\nreasoning: The client’s perception of others hearing their thoughts and judging them aligns with the [Mind Reading] cognitive \nerror, where they assume others are aware of their inner thoughts and judgments. Additionally, the client’s tendency to \nengage in self-harm when facing difficulties is indicative of the [Emotional Reasoning] cognitive error, as they treat their \nemotional reactions as facts. The client’s extreme reaction to not being able to find an answer online and resorting to self-\nharm suggests [Catastrophizing], focusing on the worst-case scenario. The overall sense of being judged and the extreme \nreactions indicate a pattern of [All-or-Nothing Thinking] and [Comparing and Despairing].\ngenerated_answer:\n Answer: [Mind reading]\nPsyche-R1\n1. Key Analysis: The client feels like others can hear their thoughts and judge them, experiences intense anger and self-harm \nwhen faced with problems, and believes everyone is watching them. These feelings and thoughts indicate a distorted \nperception of reality and self.\n2. Step Reasoning:\n- The client assumes others can hear their thoughts and judge them, indicating an assumption about others' thoughts.\n- They experience intense emotions leading to self-harm when faced with problems, suggesting an overwhelming sense of \nhopelessness or despair.\n- The client wonders if they are \"insane,\" indicating a possible distortion in thinking.\n3.
