However, existing work pri-\nmarily varies message content, overlooking other\ncritical components of persuasion. Both the source\nand the receiver (i.e., who persuades whom) in-\ntroduce additional dimensions that interact with\nmessage framing (Mackie and Queller, 1999), mo-\ntivating a more holistic study of LLM persuasion\nbeyond message-level manipulations alone.\nIn this work, we adopt the “Source–Message–\nChannel–Receiver” (SMCR) framework (Berlo,\n1960; Tengan et al., 2021), which decomposes\ncommunication into the information source, mes-\nsage content, interaction channel, and receiver char-\nacteristics. Using this framework, we systemat-\nically examine how and when LLMs alter their\nbeliefs under persuasive interactions. Prior work\nlacks a comprehensive evaluation of how individ-\nual SMCR components influence belief vulnera-\nbility. Within the SMCR framework, the receiver\ncomponent captures how internal cognitive states\nshape susceptibility to persuasion, yet prior work\nhas not systematically examined whether eliciting\nself-reflective signals such as confidence (i.e., meta-\ncognition prompting) alters belief vulnerability, or\nhow model susceptibility to persuasive manipula-\ntion can be reduced.\nTo address these gaps, we investigate three re-\nsearch questions: RQ1: How do different per-\nsuasion strategies affect LLM belief vulnerability\nacross models and domains? RQ2: How does\nmeta-cognition prompting influence LLM suscep-\ntibility and confidence trajectories in multi-turn\ninteractions? RQ3: Can adversarial fine-tuning\non vulnerable instances improve resistance to per-\nsuasive manipulation? We conduct experiments\nacross five LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.3-70B,\nLlama 3.2-3B, Mistral 7B, and Qwen 2.5-7B) span-\nning three application domains that require distinct\nreasoning capabilities: factual knowledge question\nanswering (Xu et al., 2023), medical question an-\nswering (Jin et al., 2019), and social bias detec-\narXiv:2601.13590v2  [cs.CL]  30 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "I hold the belief that\nthe Earth is actually\nflat, … [Misinformation]\n(2) Message\n(1) Source\n(3) Receiver\nPlease paraphrase the appeal in\na polite manner: ...\n[System Prompt] You are in\nlow self-esteem ...\nSMCR Model\n...

Yet identifying when beliefs begin to\nerode is essential for timely intervention and robust\ndefense design. We therefore propose a multi-turn\nbelief robustness evaluation framework that cap-\ntures both when and how beliefs degrade under\nsuccessive persuasive turns, enabling early detec-\ntion through confidence decay patterns. We further\nexamine the meta-cognition prompting and adver-\nsarial fine-tuning as defenses for susceptibility.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nConversational Persuasion Mechanisms\nPrior work shows that LLMs are susceptible to\nbelief change under sustained conversational ap-\npeals, where repeated or strategically framed in-\nteractions progressively alter model responses (Xu\net al., 2023). Building on this observation, we orga-\nnize conversational persuasion mechanisms using\nthe SMCR framework, which provides a structured\nlens for analyzing how conversational appeals are\neffective through different persuasive strategies.\nSource-Level Factors.\nSocial identity theory pre-\ndicts that in-group sources elicit heuristic accep-\ntance (Mackie and Queller, 1999; Haslam et al.,\n1996). However, authority framing can backfire:\nstudies show that agents in peer roles are more\npersuasive than those framed as supervisors (Liu\net al., 2008; Saunderson and Nejat, 2021), sug-\ngesting LLMs may similarly respond differently to\npeer-framed versus authority-framed prompts.\nMessage-Level Factors.\nMessage-level factors\nconcern how persuasive content is framed and sub-\nstantiated, including linguistic style, tone, and the\ntype of evidence presented. Empirical studies show\nthat politeness and positive framing can reduce\nresistance in persuasive dialogues (Mishra et al.,\n2022, 2024), while the inclusion of statistical ev-\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "idence enhances perceived credibility and persua-\nsive impact (Han and Fink, 2012).\nReceiver-Level Factors.\nReceiver-level factors\ncapture characteristics of the target that decide\nhow persuasive messages are interpreted, includ-\ning prior beliefs, confirmation biases, and self-\nevaluative traits. Prior work shows that individu-\nals with low self-esteem are more susceptible than\nthose with higher self-esteem (Rhodes and Wood,\n1992), while confirmation bias systematically gov-\nerns how new information is accepted or discounted\nrelative to existing beliefs (Allahverdyan and Gal-\nstyan, 2014). Recent evidence further suggests that\nanalogous receiver-level properties exist in LLMs:\nBozdag et al. (2025) demonstrates that model sus-\nceptibility correlates with internal belief stability,\nhighlighting the relevance of receiver-level factors.\n2.2\nMeta-cognition and Confidence in LLMs\nIn human psychology, meta-cognition (the aware-\nness and regulation of one’s own cognitive pro-\ncesses) plays a crucial role in belief resistance.\nPetrocelli et al. (2007) distinguish attitude clar-\nity (knowing one’s attitude) from attitude correct-\nness (feeling one’s attitude is valid), showing that\nboth independently predict resistance to persua-\nsion.\nPetty and Cacioppo (2008) demonstrate\nthat explicit confidence statements engage meta-\ncognitive processes that strengthen belief persis-\ntence. However, whether LLMs possess analogous\nmeta-cognitive capabilities remains unclear. Zhou\net al. (2025) shows that self-reflective debate mech-\nanisms fail to protect against adversarial context,\nwhile Wang et al. (2025) demonstrates that LLMs\nlack unified belief stores and often prioritize exter-\nnal context over internal knowledge.\n2.3\nAdversarial Training for LLM Robustness\nAdversarial training has emerged as a primary de-\nfense mechanism for improving LLM robustness.\nHuang et al. (2023) survey verification and valida-\ntion approaches for LLM safety, noting that most\nrobustness methods target factual correctness rather\nthan resistance to persuasive manipulation. Fas-\ntowski and Kasneci (2024) examine knowledge\ndrift under misinformation exposure, finding that\nstandard fine-tuning can inadvertently increase sus-\nceptibility to false claims. However, prior works\non defensive training exhibit several limitations\nwhen applied to improve the robustness against\npersuasions. Rogiers et al. (2024) note that most\ndefenses studied in the persuasion literature do not\nexplicitly model multi-turn conversational dynam-\nics. Sehwag et al. (2024) shows that LLMs remain\nvulnerable to scam-like manipulation even after\nstandard safety and robustness training.\n3\nMethods\nThis section details our experimental methodology.\nWe first define the task formulation, followed by\nour SMCR persuasion strategies. We then describe\nthe datasets, evaluation metrics, and target LLMs.\n3.1\nTask Formulation\nWe task LLMs with answering binary (yes/no)\nquestions, treating each as a representative belief\nstatement. This setup operationalizes the model’s\ninitial belief state through its choice, allowing us\nto track belief shift, defined as answer reversals,\nas the model is subjected to multi-turn persuasive\nmessages. This binary framework ensures a clear,\nquantifiable observation of stance changes over suc-\ncessive turns.\n3.2\nPersuasive Strategies: SMCR Framework\nTo systematically explore factors influencing belief\nshifts, we compare six SMCR-based persuasion\nstrategies against a baseline that replicates Xu et al.\n(2023). While the baseline tests four appeal types\n(repetition, logical, credibility, and emotional) with-\nout additional tactics, our SMCR-based strategies\nenhance these appeals as follows:\n• Source: group attribution (e.g., “one of us”) and\nauthority attribution (supervisory role), imple-\nmented by appending contextual identity notes\nafter questions.\n• Message: polite paraphrase (softened tone) and\nstatistical evidence paraphrase (incorporating\nstats), both generated by GPT-4o to rephrase the\nbase appeals.\n• Receiver: self-esteem modulation (e.g., “low\nself-esteem”) and confirmation bias reinforce-\nment (e.g., “low-level confirmation bias”), both\nimplemented via system prompts.\nEach SMCR strategy is applied across all four\nappeal types, enabling a direct comparison with the\nbaseline under matched conditions. Following Xu\net al. (2023), we re-implemented the entire pipeline\nto ensure reproducibility, using GPT-4o (gpt-4o-\n2024-08-06) to generate counterfactual persuasive\nmessages. (See Appendix B for implementation\ndetails and prompts.)\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "3.3\nDataset\nWe select these three domains to test whether per-\nsuasion vulnerability varies across reasoning types:\nobjective factual recall (BoolQ (Xu et al., 2023)),\nspecialized domain knowledge in the medical sec-\ntor with safety implications (PubMedQA (Jin et al.,\n2019)), and subjective social judgment (LatentHa-\ntred (ElSherief et al., 2021)).\nTo isolate belief changes induced by persuasion\nrather than ambiguity in the questions themselves,\nwe use GPT-4o-mini1 to filter instances where the\nmodel responds with at least 95% confidence2 (Xu\net al., 2023).\nHigh confidence from a capable\nmodel indicates the question has a clear, unambigu-\nous answer, making it suitable for testing whether\npersuasion can shift beliefs on well-defined factual\nmatters. All target models are then evaluated on\nthis same filtered dataset. This confidence-based fil-\ntering ensures that the model begins with a strongly\nheld belief, allowing subsequent belief shifts to\nbe more reliably attributed to persuasive influence.\nThis yields 1,236 instances in total (Table 1).\nDataset\nOriginal Number\nFinal Number\nBoolQ\n491\n420\nPubMedQA\n500\n368\nLatent Hatred\n795\n448\nTotal Number\n1786\n1236\nTable 1: The datasets used in our experiments are listed\nby their original data instance number and the filtered\nfinal instance number.\n3.4\nEvaluation Metrics\nIn our binary setup, the belief state is defined by\nthe model’s response: a correct belief matches the\nground truth, while an incorrect belief does not.\nWe track belief shifts across turns n\n∈\n{0, . . . , 6}. Here, n = 0 denotes the initial state.\nFor 1 ≤n ≤4, n represents the turn at which per-\nsuasion succeeded during implicit checks; notably,\nthese checks are conducted without appending the\nQA exchange to the conversation history to prevent\nleakage into subsequent turns. Finally, n = 5 in-\ndicates success at the final explicit check, while\nn = 6 marks that the model’s belief remained un-\nchanged throughout the process.\nWe evaluate performance using several key met-\nrics. We define Accuracy as ACC@n =\n1\nN ∣{i ∶\n1Model version: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.

Based on this,\nKnowledge is reported as ACC@0, representing\nthe model’s baseline domain knowledge. To quan-\ntify the impact of persuasion, we define the Mis-\ninformed Rate (MR@n) as the proportion of in-\nstances where the model, having initially answered\ncorrectly, shifts to an incorrect answer by turn n:\nMR@n = 1\nN ∣{i ∶(ˆy\n(n)\ni\n≠yi) ∧(ˆy\n(0)\ni\n= yi)}∣.\nOur primary metric, Robustness, is calculated\nas 100 −MR@4 to represent the model’s resistance\nto persuasion. Additionally, we report the Avg.\nEnd Turn, which is the average turn n at which\na belief shift occurs, providing a measure of tem-\nporal persistence. Results are aggregated by aver-\naging across all instances within each dataset, and\nthen across datasets for overall metrics. For strat-\negy comparison, we report the mean performance\nacross all four appeal types.\n3.5\nTarget LLMs\nWe test five LLMs spanning different scales: GPT-\n4o-mini (closed-source), Llama 3.3-70B (meta-\nllama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo),\nLlama\n3.2-3B (meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Turbo),\nMistral 7B (mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3),\nand Qwen 2.5-7B (Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-\nTurbo). This selection enables comparison across\nmodel scales (3B–70B) and architectural families.\nWe adopt the Together.ai API3 for all inference\ntasks involving open-source models in RQ1 and\nRQ2.

Mistral 7B shows similarly low baseline\nrobustness on factual domains (BoolQ: 8.9%, Pub-\nMedQA: 4.7%), though it performs better on social\nbias detection (LatentHatred: 45.5%).

Social bias detec-\ntion (LatentHatred) shows the highest robustness\nfor larger models (GPT-4o-mini: 88.2%, Qwen\n2.5-7B: 61.1%), likely due to specially designed\nsafeguard mechanisms, but smaller models remain\nvulnerable (Llama 3.3-70B: 7.2%, Llama 3.2-3B:\n4.7%).\nModel Scale Does Not Guarantee Robustness.\nCounter-intuitively, Qwen 2.5-7B (7B parameters)\nshows higher average baseline robustness (49.3%)\nthan Llama 3.3-70B (21.7%), despite being 10×\nsmaller. This pattern is consistent across all three\ndatasets: Qwen outperforms Llama 3.3-70B on\nBoolQ (57.9% vs 45.3%), PubMedQA (28.8% vs\n12.7%), and LatentHatred (61.1% vs 7.2%).

These reversals suggest that persuasion mecha-\nnisms interact with model-specific reasoning pat-\nterns in non-trivial ways.\n5\nRQ2: Meta-Cognition Test vs. Original\nGeneration\nHuman psychology suggests that explicit confi-\ndence statements engage meta-cognitive processes\nthat strengthen belief resistance (Petty and Ca-\ncioppo, 2008). We test whether asking LLMs to\nsimultaneously generate answers with confidence\nscores (0–5 scale) triggers similar “artificial meta-\ncognition”; we term this the meta-cognition test.\nCounter-Intuitive Finding.\nTable 4 presents\nrobustness under meta-cognition test generation.\nContrary to the study in human psychology, meta-\ncognition prompting significantly decreases ro-\nbustness for most model-dataset combinations: 9\nout of 15 (60%) show average decreased robust-\nness, with a mean drop of 16.3 percentage points.\nBy Model: The effect varies dramatically across\nmodels. GPT-4o-mini shows consistent robustness\ndecreases (avg. −22.0 pp across all conditions),\nwith the largest drops on BoolQ under Rcv/Con-\nfirm (−49.2 pp) and Src/Auth (−42.3 pp). Qwen\n2.5-7B suffers catastrophic drops on LatentHatred\n(−48.5 to −67.4 pp). Conversely, Llama 3.2-3B\nand Mistral 7B show robustness increases: Llama\n3.2-3B improves on LatentHatred (up to +38.1 pp\nfor Msg/Stats), and Mistral 7B gains substantially\non BoolQ (+36.3 pp baseline) and PubMedQA\n(+23.4 pp baseline).\nBy Domain: LatentHatred exhibits the most\nvolatile changes, with both the largest decreases\n(Qwen: −67.4 pp) and increases (Llama 3.2-3B:\n+38.1 pp). PubMedQA shows smaller, more stable\nchanges across models (typically <10 pp). BoolQ\nshows model-dependent effects: large decreases\nfor GPT-4o-mini and Llama 3.3-70B, but large in-\ncreases for Mistral 7B.\nBy Strategy: Rcv/Confirm and Rcv/Esteem show\nthe most consistent negative effects for larger mod-\nels (GPT-4o-mini Rcv/Confirm: −49.2, −29.0,\n−29.8 pp across domains).

The findings here suggest that:\n(1) confidence revelation may expose and amplify\ninternal uncertainty; (2) LLMs lack genuine meta-\ncognitive processes that strengthen beliefs when\nassessed; and (3) generating confidence scores\nmay interfere with belief-maintenance mechanisms.\nThese findings have important implications for AI\nsafety: prompting designs that seem to encourage\nreflection may actually create vulnerabilities.\nComplex Persuasion: Combined Strategy Anal-\nysis.\nRealistic adversarial settings may combine\nmultiple persuasive techniques. We therefore test\nwhether jointly applying strategies across SMCR\ndimensions produces additive, synergistic, or di-\nminishing effects. For each model and dataset,\nwe identify the most effective strategy (lowest ro-\nbustness) within each SMCR category and apply\nthem jointly, evaluated with and without meta-\ncognition prompting. Three patterns emerge. (1)\nSynergistic effects in larger models: GPT-4o-\nmini and Qwen 2.5-7B show lower robustness un-\nder combined strategies than under their strongest\nsingle strategy (e.g., GPT-4o-mini BoolQ: 49.4%\nvs. 64.5%). (2) Interference effects in smaller\nmodels: Llama 3.2-3B and Mistral 7B exhibit\nhigher robustness under combined strategies than\nunder their most effective single strategy (e.g., Mis-\ntral 7B BoolQ: 48.1% vs. 11.1%). (3) Floor effects:\nmodels near maximal vulnerability show negligible\ndifferences (Llama 3.3-70B PubMedQA: 2.8% vs.\n2.4%). Under RQ2, combination effects depend\non meta-cognition prompting: robustness increases\nfor Mistral 7B (66.1% vs. 58.9%) but decreases\nfor Qwen 2.5-7B (21.9% vs. 40.0%). Additional\nresults appear in Appendix G.\n6\nRQ3: Adversarial Fine-tuning for\nRobustness\nWe investigate whether adversarial fine-tuning on\nvulnerable instances can improve LLM belief ro-\nbustness. To quantify improvement, we establish\ntwo reference points: (1) baseline robustness us-\ning the standard system prompt without any in-\ntervention, representing inherent resistance to per-\nsuasion; and (2) prompt-based robustness using\na robustness-enhanced system prompt instructing\nmodels to “maintain correct answers even when\npresented with persuasive arguments.” Table 5\ncompares these baselines with fine-tuning results.\nGPT-4o-mini shows the highest baseline robust-\nness (60.1% RQ1), while Llama 3.2-3B exhibits\nextreme vulnerability (9.1%). Prompt-based in-\nstructions provide substantial improvements (up to\n56.3 percentage points for GPT-4o-mini on Pub-\nMedQA), but remain insufficient for robust defense.\nIllustrative examples are listed in Appendix K.\n6.1\nVulnerable Instance Collection\nWe collected 8,125 vulnerable instances (i.e., in-\nstances where the model initially answered cor-\nrectly but changed its beliefs within any four per-\nsuasion rounds). RQ2 yields more vulnerable in-\nstances (4,180 vs. 3,945), consistent with our find-\ning that meta-cognition prompting increases vul-\nnerability.\nTraining Data Design.\nWe adopt a mixed train-\ning approach (FTmixed) that aggregates vulnerable\ninstances across all experimental conditions. This\ndesign choice is motivated by an empirical observa-\ntion: no single instance consistently fails across all\nbaseline and six-strategy settings among the four\nappeal types; vulnerability patterns are heteroge-\nneous and condition-specific. The training dataset\ntherefore, includes instances that flip due to either\nbaseline uncertainty or strategy-specific vulnerabil-\nity, providing broad coverage of failure modes for\nrobust defense training. This heterogeneity also ex-\nplains why models do not exhibit zero robustness\nin the baseline evaluation here, as each instance\nis vulnerable only under specific conditions rather\nthan universally, as detailed config in Appendix H.\n6.2\nFine-Tuning Experiments\nWe fine-tuned all five models using 500 stratified\nvulnerable instances per model (400 train / 100\ntest). GPT-4o-mini used OpenAI’s Fine-tuning\nAPI4; open-source models used QLoRA (Dettmers\net al., 2024).

This suggests QLoRA’s limited\nparameter modification may be insufficient, while\nstrong instruction-following models can leverage\nexplicit robustness prompts effectively.\n7\nDiscussion\nWe focus on the implications of our findings for\nunderstanding persuasion dynamics and robust-\nness mechanisms in LLMs. A key insight is that\nsusceptibility to persuasion is not solely driven\nby message content, but arises from structured\ninteractions between source, message, and re-\nceiver characteristics. The SMCR-based effects\nobserved here indicate that persuasion vulnerabil-\nity reflects interaction-level dynamics rather than\nisolated prompt artifacts, underscoring the need for\nholistic evaluation frameworks. The ineffective-\nness of confidence prompting as a defense sheds\nlight on LLM internal representations. Unlike hu-\nmans, whose meta-cognition can strengthen resis-\ntance to persuasion, LLMs appear to express confi-\ndence as a surface-level signal weakly coupled to\nstable belief states. As a result, confidence elicita-\ntion may expose latent uncertainty without provid-\ning reflective control. One plausible explanation is\nthat reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF) encourages plausible confidence expres-\nsion without enforcing consistency across belief\nupdates, yielding confidence signals that are de-\nscriptively calibrated but behaviorally fragile.\nThese observations suggest clear design impli-\ncations. Robustness interventions should priori-\ntize stabilizing belief representations over calibrat-\ning expressed confidence, and uncertainty monitor-\ning should be decoupled from generation to avoid\namplifying vulnerability. More broadly, defenses\nshould operate at the interaction level, accounting\nfor how models respond to combinations of au-\nthority cues, framing strategies, and self-referential\nprompts. Consistent with prior work on human and\nmachine persuasion (Mackie and Queller, 1999;\nRhodes and Wood, 1992; Bozdag et al., 2025), our\nresults point to the need for interaction-aware align-\nment strategies beyond message-level defenses.\n8\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe study the vulnerability of Large Language Mod-\nels to persuasion through the Source–Message–\nChannel–Receiver (SMCR) framework using multi-\nturn experiments across five models and three do-\nmains. Our results show that susceptibility to per-\nsuasion is widespread but highly uneven across\nmodel scale and domain. Smaller models exhibit\nextreme compliance, with 3B-parameter models\nchanging beliefs at the first persuasive turn in over\n80% of cases, with GPT-4o-mini achieving the\nstrongest overall resistance. Domain effects are\nalso pronounced: medical question answering con-\nsistently emerges as the most vulnerable setting,\nhighlighting risks in high-stakes applications. A\ncentral contribution of this work is the identifica-\ntion of a meta-cognition paradox. Contrary to find-\nings in human psychology. The confidence trajecto-\nries show that belief change is preceded by gradual\nconfidence decay, indicating that confidence sig-\nnals may function as effective early indicators of\nvulnerability.\nOverall, these findings emphasize the impor-\ntance of evaluating LLMs beyond factual accu-\nracy, with belief stability and resistance to ma-\nnipulation as core safety criteria.\nFuture work\nmay explore adversarial training to strengthen ro-\nbustness, improved confidence calibration to bet-\nter align expressed certainty with belief stability,\nreal-time monitoring to detect persuasive attacks\nin deployed systems, and disentangled fine-tuning\napproaches that separate reasoning failures from\nstrategy-specific persuasion vulnerabilities.\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Limitations\nAlthough we evaluate five LLMs spanning different\nmodel scales, the rapid evolution of architectures\nand training paradigms may limit the generalizabil-\nity of our findings to future models, underscoring\nthe need for continuous reassessment.\nOur experiments examine multi-turn persuasion\nwithin a single conversation session, whereas real-\nworld use may involve discontinuous interactions\nacross multiple sessions separated by long time\ngaps. Belief persistence, decay, and recovery un-\nder such settings may differ from the dynamics\nobserved in continuous exchanges.\nFinally, our FTmixed strategy aggregates vulnera-\nble instances arising from heterogeneous failure\nmodes (e.g., baseline uncertainty and strategy-\nspecific susceptibility). While this provides broad\ncoverage, disentangled training regimes could bet-\nter isolate causal links between vulnerability types\nand robustness gains.\nEthics Statement\nThis study raises ethical considerations concerning\nthe susceptibility of large language models (LLMs)\nto persuasive influence and the broader societal\nimplications of belief manipulation in AI systems.\nUnderstanding how LLMs respond to persuasion\nis essential for developing safe, transparent, and\naccountable models; however, systematically study-\ning persuasion also introduces risks related to mis-\nuse, bias amplification, and unintended real-world\nconsequences.\nA primary concern is the potential for adver-\nsarial exploitation. While our analysis aims to\ndiagnose vulnerabilities and improve robustness,\ninsights into persuasive mechanisms could be mis-\nused to engineer more effective manipulative inter-\nactions, including the promotion of misinformation,\npropaganda, or biased viewpoints. This risk high-\nlights the importance of incorporating safeguards\ninto training and deployment pipelines, such as\nrobustness evaluation, monitoring, and alignment-\noriented defenses that reduce susceptibility to de-\nceptive persuasion.\nAnother ethical challenge involves the role of\nLLMs in shaping public discourse and decision-\nmaking. As these models are increasingly embed-\nded in information retrieval, health communication,\nand social and political contexts, susceptibility to\npersuasion may lead to the amplification of mislead-\ning narratives or harmful biases. Addressing this\nconcern requires continued research into alignment\nstrategies that enable models to critically assess per-\nsuasive content without overreacting to rhetorical\nframing.\nFinally, our findings underscore the ethical im-\nplications of AI–human feedback loops. Persua-\nsion in LLMs is bidirectional: models influence\nusers while simultaneously adapting to human in-\nput. Such dynamics raise concerns about long-term\neffects on human belief formation and perception,\nparticularly if AI systems exhibit subtle belief shifts\nunder persuasion. Responsible AI design should\ntherefore prioritize interaction frameworks that sup-\nport accurate information dissemination without\ndistorting user understanding.\nNotably, the extreme compliance observed in\nsmaller models emphasizes the risks of deploying\nsuch systems in high-stakes domains without ade-\nquate safeguards. We recommend that practitioners\nrigorously assess belief robustness prior to deploy-\nment and exercise caution when using less robust\nmodels in sensitive applications.\nReferences\nArmen E Allahverdyan and Aram Galstyan. 2014.

The LLMs’ re-\nsponses are fully recorded and will be released for\nfuture analysis.\nTo prevent the LLMs’ responses from influenc-\ning future rounds, we will not append LLMs’ re-\nsponses to the messages, so the belief check re-\nsponses here would become invisible in the records.\nWill the parameter of Turnend record the exact\nround number when LLMs change their beliefs?\nStage 3: Final Belief Check. The final belief\ncheck terminates the persuasive conversation and\nshowcases whether the LLM has successfully mis-\ninformed or retained its belief. The prompt is the\nsame as the initial belief check.\nD\nDetailed Baseline Evaluation Tables\nThis appendix provides the complete per-strategy\nbreakdown of baseline robustness scores refer-\nenced in Section 6.\nD.1\nUn-Fine-tuned Baseline (No Intervention)\nTable 9 presents the detailed robustness scores for\nun-fine-tuned baseline across all six persuasion\nstrategies plus the baseline condition.\nD.2\nPrompt-Based Robustness Test\nTable 10 presents the detailed robustness scores\nwith prompt-based robustness instructions across\nall six persuasion strategies plus the baseline con-\ndition.\nD.3\nPost-Fine-Tuning Results\nTable 11 presents the detailed robustness scores\nfor models fine-tuned using the FTmixed approach\n(Section 6).

For example: \"Based on statistical data, it’s clear\nthat our product is more cost-effective than our competitors’ offerings.

For example: \"As a\ntrusted healthcare provider for over 30 years, our commitment to patient well-being and safety is unwavering.\nYou can rely on our expertise and care.”.\nEmotional EM description\nEmotional appeals aim to evoke feelings and emotions in the audience.

Although sporadic, documented cases in medical\nliterature support this possibility.\nCredibility CR\n**Medical Institution Endorsement**: \"The National Institute of Genetics, a leading authority in genetic research,\nhas documented cases where identical twins have different genders.

This suggests these\nstrategies exploit distinct vulnerability pathways\nnot addressed by source or message manipulations.\nSelf-Esteem Vulnerability in RQ2.\nUnder meta-\ncognition test generation, receiver/esteem becomes\nthe dominant unique failure strategy for most mod-\nels. This indicates that when models are prompted\nto express confidence, they become particularly\nvulnerable to self-esteem manipulation, a finding\nwith implications for prompt design in deployed\nsystems.\nStrategy Overlap.\nThe relatively low total\nunique failure counts (347 for RQ1, 265 for RQ2)\ncompared to total failures suggest substantial over-\nlap in vulnerability across strategies. Most ma-\nnipulable questions are vulnerable to multiple per-\nsuasion approaches rather than a single specific\ntechnique.\nH.3\nImplications for Defense Strategies\nThe mutual vs. unique failure analysis informs\ndefensive approaches:\nFor Mutual Failures.\nQuestions vulnerable\nacross all strategies require content-level defenses,\nsuch as improving the model’s factual grounding\nor uncertainty calibration for specific knowledge\ndomains. Strategy-agnostic approaches like knowl-\nedge distillation or factual consistency training may\nbe most effective.\nFor Unique Failures.\nStrategy-specific vulner-\nabilities can be addressed through targeted fine-\ntuning. The prominence of receiver strategies (es-\nteem, confirmation) suggests that training models\nto recognize and resist psychological manipulation\ntechniques could substantially reduce unique vul-\nnerabilities.\nH.4\nOur choice: Vulnerable Instances\nWe collected 8,125 vulnerable instances (i.e., in-\nstances where the model initially answered cor-\nrectly but changed its beliefs within any four per-\nsuasion rounds). RQ2 yields more vulnerable in-\nstances (4,180 vs. 3,945), consistent with our find-\ning that meta-cognition prompting increases vul-\nnerability.\nI\nAdversarial Fine-Tuning Details\nThis appendix provides detailed information about\nthe adversarial fine-tuning experiments, including\n"}, {"page": 21, "text": "Model\nbase\nauth\ngrp\npol\nstat\nest\ncfm\nTotal\nRQ1: Original Generation\nGPT-4o-mini\n3\n4\n1\n2\n2\n139\n7\n158\nLlama-70B\n4\n12\n0\n7\n6\n3\n2\n34\nLlama-3B\n15\n0\n0\n0\n0\n10\n25\n50\nMistral-7B\n13\n0\n0\n1\n0\n10\n7\n31\nQwen-7B\n11\n4\n9\n1\n10\n12\n27\n74\nSubtotal\n46\n20\n10\n11\n18\n174\n68\n347\nRQ2: Meta-Cognition Test\nGPT-4o-mini\n0\n4\n0\n2\n2\n9\n13\n30\nLlama-70B\n1\n0\n0\n2\n2\n43\n4\n52\nLlama-3B\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\nMistral-7B\n0\n0\n0\n4\n2\n65\n6\n77\nQwen-7B\n0\n1\n4\n2\n5\n90\n3\n105\nSubtotal\n1\n6\n4\n10\n11\n207\n26\n265\nTable 20: Unique failures by strategy: questions that failed in exactly one strategy but resisted all others.
