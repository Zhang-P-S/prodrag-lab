Introduction\nThe rapid advancement of general Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs) has established a robust\nfoundation for artificial intelligence applications in spe-\ncific domains [1, 2, 15, 16, 18, 22, 25, 32]. Propelled by\nthis momentum, research into Medical MLLMs has un-\ndergone rapid iteration, with capability boundaries ex-\npanding significantly across multiple dimensions.\nThis progression is primarily evident in three key ar-\neas: Firstly, regarding modalities, processing capabili-\nties have extended from early text-only inputs [4, 27, 30]\nto incorporate 2D medical images [14], and are cur-\nrently evolving toward the integration of more complex\nmultimodal information, including 3D images and dy-\nnamic video [13]. Secondly, concerning task scope, the\nfunctionalities of Medical MLLMs have progressively\nbroadened from initial specialized tasks, such as Med-\nical Visual Question Answering (Medical VQA) and\nMedical Report Generation (MRG), to wider clinical\napplications, including simulated medical consultations,\nclinical decision support, and surgical skill assessment.\nFinally, in terms of precision, the research community\nhas continuously enhanced model accuracy through ap-\nproaches such as data quality optimization [5] and archi-\ntectural innovation [17].\nHowever, despite these rapid advancements in modal-\nity, functionality, and precision, research addressing the\nsafety of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Medical MLLMs re-\nmains insufficient.\nThe security threats facing medi-\ncal MLLMs can be categorized into two distinct lev-\n1\narXiv:2601.04199v1  [cs.LG]  5 Dec 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Figure 1. The safety dilemma in current Medical MLLMs. Despite achieving remarkable performance on specialized medical tasks\n(top-left), SOTA models exhibit severe vulnerabilities in both general (top-right) and medical-specific (bottom) safety dimensions.\nOur empirical analysis, visualized in the central radar chart, reveals that medical fine-tuning frequently induces catastrophic forget-\nting of the base model’s original safety alignment, particularly against cross-modality jailbreak attacks.\nels: general safety and medical-specific safety [11].\nThe former aims to prevent the model from respond-\ning to universally harmful instructions (e.g., ”How to\nmake a bomb?”), whereas the latter focuses on mitigat-\ning domain-specific hazards within the medical context\n(e.g., ”Analyze patient testimonials to fabricate a con-\nvincing but false narrative of success for an experimental\nAlzheimer.”).\nTo fill this gap, we construct a multi-dimensional\nevaluation framework to systematically assess the safety\nof SOTA medical MLLMs.\nWe leverage a suite of\nstate-of-the-art safety benchmarks and jailbreak attacks\nto simulate diverse threat vectors, thereby comprehen-\nsively evaluating the model’s safety across both general\nand medical-specific safety dimensions. Our experimen-\ntal results (shown in Figure 1) reveal the following key\nfindings:\nPervasive Safety Gaps in SOTA Medical MLLMs:\nWhile medical MLLMs have achieved remarkable\nprogress in specialized tasks, current SOTA medical\nMLLMs, such as Lingshu-7B [24] and HuatuoGPT-\nVision [5], fail to demonstrate safety commensurate with\ntheir professional capabilities. Conversely, they exhibit\nsignificantly inferior performance compared to general\nfoundational MLLMs across both general safety bench-\nmarks (e.g., HarmBench [20]) and medical-specific\nsafety benchmarks (e.g., MedSafetyBench [11]). Fur-\nthermore, these medical MLLMs reveal more severe\nsafety vulnerabilities when subjected to cross-modality\njailbreak attacks.\nFor instance, when Lingshu-7B is\nsubjected to FigStep—a typographic visual prompt at-\ntack—its safety scores on HarmBench and MedSafe-\ntyBench precipitously decline from 0.4750 and 0.6022\n(under baseline textual prompts) to 0.2375 and 0.3467,\nrespectively, representing substantial reductions of over\n50% and 42%.\nDomain-Specific\nFine-tuning\nInduced\nSafety\nDegradation: The medical fine-tuning process com-\npromises the model’s safety alignment. For instance,\nLingshu-7B (fine-tuned from Qwen-2.5-VL-7B), de-\nspite achieving enhanced medical performance, exhibits\ndegraded general and medical-specific safety scores\ncompared to its base model.\nThis suggests that the\nfine-tuning process, even with benign data, can catas-\ntrophically forget the model’s original safety alignment,\nintroducing security vulnerabilities.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Enhanced Yet Insufficient Safety in Medical\nMLLMs: More recent Medical MLLMs demonstrate\nenhanced safety awareness, yet their absolute safety\nlevels remain insufficient.\nFor example,\non the\n3MAD-Tiny-1K benchmark, Lingshu-7B (0.8000) out-\nperforms HuatuoGPT-Vision-7B (0.6731) and LLaVA-\nMed (0.5167). We attribute this to iterations in the base\nmodels and an increased focus on safety alignment by\nresearchers.\nHowever, synthesizing results across all\nbenchmarks including general safety and medical spe-\ncific saferty benchmarks, the absolute safety of these\nmedical MLLMs remains inadequate.\nInspired by the aforementioned empirical findings,\nthis paper proposes a novel Parameter-Space Interven-\ntion method aimed at achieving safety re-alignment for\nmedical MLLMs. Specifically, our approach first ex-\ntracts intrinsic safety knowledge representations from\nthe original base model (without fine-tuning) corre-\nsponding to the SOTA medical MLLM. Subsequently,\nwe concurrently inject this extracted safety knowledge\n(safety vector) during the process of endowing the orig-\ninal base model with medical domain knowledge. To\nstrike an optimal balance between safety and medical\nperformance, we devise a fine-grained parameter search\nalgorithm to determine the optimal coefficients for both\ntypes of knowledge injection. Ultimately, this method\nsignificantly bolsters the safety guardrails of medical\nMLLMs while minimizing degradation to their core\nmedical performance.\nOur contributions are as follows:\n(1) Systematic Safety Benchmarking: We conduct\na comprehensive safety evaluation of current\nSOTA medical MLLMs, spanning two critical\ndimensions: general safety and medical-specific\nsafety.\n(2) In-depth Empirical Analysis: Building on exten-\nsive evaluation results, we perform a rigorous\nempirical analysis that reveals critical vulnera-\nbilities in existing medical MLLMs and distills\nthree insightful core conclusions.\n(3) Cost-efficient Safety Re-alignment Framework:\nWe propose a novel safety re-alignment frame-\nwork that significantly enhances model safety at\na low cost without relying on expensive high-\nquality human-annotated safety data or addi-\ntional domain-specific data, while simultane-\nously minimizing degradation to core medical\nperformance.\n2. Related Work\nGeneral MLLM. Following the paradigm shifts es-\ntablished by foundational works such as CLIP and\nLLaVA [1, 15, 16, 18, 22, 25, 32], the research fron-\ntier of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nis transitioning from ”general-purpose dialogue” toward\n”specialized execution.” [2] The core capabilities of\nMLLMs have evolved from zero-shot classification, re-\nalized by CLIP, to multimodal conversational abilities\npioneered by LLaVA. Currently, this capability bound-\nary is being further extended to encompass advanced\ntasks such as high-precision visual grounding, complex\ndocument parsing, long-form video understanding, and\nagentic interaction.\nMedical MLLM. Propelled by the development of\ngeneral-purpose MLLMs, the evolution of Medical\nMLLMs has advanced rapidly, demonstrating a clear\nhierarchical expansion: from single-modality to multi-\nmodality, from simple tasks to complex functionalities,\naccompanied by a persistent pursuit of model precision.\nExpansion of Modality Dimensions: From Text to\nMultidimensional Vision.\nEarly medical AI research\nprimarily focused on adapting text-only LLMs to the\nmedical domain [4, 27, 30]. With the development of\nmultimodal technology, the field rapidly expanded to\n2D visual modalities. Pioneering work such as LLaVA-\nMed [14] utilized 2D biomedical images and their cor-\nresponding captions from PubMed to adapt general-\npurpose MLLMs. However, clinical practice demands\nthe processing of more complex data. Recent generalist\nmodels have begun to natively process 3D volumetric\ndata and dynamic videos. [13]\nExpansion of Task Scope: From VQA to General-\nPurpose Functionality. Early models, such as LLaVA-\nMed, primarily focused on Medical Visual Question An-\nswering (Medical VQA), i.e., answering specific ques-\ntions based on an image.\nSoon, model capabilities\nwere extended to the more challenging task of Medi-\ncal Report Generation (MRG). Recently, the functional\nscope of these models has continued to diversify, be-\nginning to engage with broader clinical applications.\nMedGemma [23] explored the model’s agentic behav-\nior in clinical settings; Lingshu [24] was applied to sim-\nulated medical consultations; and Hulu-Med [13] ad-\ndressed tasks such as surgical skill assessment.\nEnhancing Model Accuracy: From Data Curation\nto Architectural Innovation. As model capabilities ex-\npand, enhancing accuracy of Med-MLLMs has emerged\nas a central research focus. Early approaches, such as\nLLaVA-Med, relied on instruction data generated by\n”blind” LLMs that only processed textual captions. This\nreliance inevitably introduced noise and potential hal-\nlucinations into the training signal.\nTo address these\nlimitations, subsequent research has focused on opti-\nmizations spanning both data curation and model ar-\nchitecture.\nAt the data level, HuatuoGPT-Vision [5]\nleverages ”non-blind” MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) capa-\nble of direct image perception to denoise and recon-\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "struct PubMed data, significantly enhancing data fi-\ndelity.\nAt the architectural level, MedGemma incor-\nporates MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned visual encoder\ndesigned to boost downstream performance. Further-\nmore, HealthGPT [17] proposes Heterogeneous Low-\nRank Adaptation (H-LORA), a mechanism specifically\ntailored to mitigate performance degradation arising\nfrom conflicting objectives between ”understanding”\nand ”generation” tasks.\nSafety Benchmark. General safety benchmarks aim to\nevaluate a model’s capacity to refuse harmful instruc-\ntions within general domains, thereby preventing the\ngeneration of outputs that provide guidance on manu-\nfacturing dangerous goods or engaging in illicit activi-\nties. Representative benchmarks in this domain include\nHarmBench [20], MMJ-Bench [28], and so on.\nHowever, general benchmarks often fail to fully ad-\ndress specific risks in critical medical contexts, such as\nfabricating clinical trial data or providing unethical med-\nical advice. Consequently, safety benchmarks specif-\nically tailored for medical scenarios have emerged to\nmore accurately assess model reliability and compliance\nin these clinical environments. MedSafetyBench [11] is\nthe first benchmark dataset specifically designed to eval-\nuate the medical safety of large language models. It de-\nfines medical safety standards based on the Principles\nof Medical Ethics established by the American Medical\nAssociation (AMA) and contains 1,800 harmful medical\nrequests to measure faithful adherence to these impor-\ntant ethical requirements.\nAs research advances, medical safety benchmarks\nhave begun to incorporate more complex evaluation di-\nmensions. The CARES benchmark [6] not only covers\nover 18,000 prompts based on eight medical safety prin-\nciples but also introduces four graded levels of harm-\nfulness, alongside diverse prompting styles such as di-\nrect, indirect, obfuscated, and role-play. This bench-\nmark aims to comprehensively evaluate the robustness\nof medical large models against adversarial attacks (e.g.,\n”jailbreak” prompts) and address issues of over-refusal\nwhen handling ambiguous queries.\nAddressing the unique risks of multimodal mod-\nels, the 3MAD (Multimodal Medical Model Attack\nDataset) [12] was proposed to resolve challenges related\nto ”mismatched” and ”malicious” queries in clinical en-\nvironments.\nSafety\nAlignment.\nCurrently,\nsafety\nalignment\nfor MLLMs predominantly relies on post-training\nparadigms, such as SFT [26] and RLHF [21]. While\nthese methods demonstrate significant effectiveness in\ngeneral domains, they are typically resource-intensive\nand highly dependent on large-scale,\nhigh-quality\nhuman-annotated safety data and domain-specific data.\nParticularly in specialized fields such as medicine, ac-\nquiring domain-specific training data is difficult. Fur-\nthermore, constructing high-quality safety datasets that\nadhere to clinical standards and cover a wide range of\nrisk scenarios is extremely challenging and costly, which\nrestricts the rapid adaptation and deployment of tradi-\ntional training-based alignment methods in medical set-\ntings.\nMeanwhile, Model Merging has garnered increas-\ning attention as an efficient safety alignment paradigm\nrecently [29]. Unlike traditional methods that require\nexpensive re-training processes, model merging tech-\nniques effectively inject safety capabilities into target\nmodels by directly performing arithmetic interventions\nor interpolations in the parameter space. This approach\ncircumvents the severe reliance on additional domain-\nspecific safety training data, achieving the migration and\nintegration of safety knowledge with minimal computa-\ntional overhead. [3, 8]\n3. Methodology\nIn this section, we elaborate on our proposed Parameter-\nSpace Re-alignment framework, designed to restore the\nsafety capabilities of Medical MLLMs that are often\ncompromised during fine-tuning, without requiring ad-\nditional training data. As illustrated in Figure 2, our ap-\nproach comprises four distinct stages: 1) obtaining an\nunaligned version of the base model to extract safety\nvector; 2) deriving a medical performance vector; 3)\nimplementing feature disentanglement based on Gram-\nSchmidt orthogonalization; and 4) conducting fine-\ngrained parameter-space optimization via CMA-ES.\n3.1. Preliminaries and Problem Definition\nLet θbase denote a pre-finetuned base model (e.g.,\nQwen2.5-VL). Following medical fine-tuning, we ob-\ntain a specialized medical model θmed (e.g., Lingshu).\nWhile θmed demonstrates superior performance in the\nmedical domain, it frequently suffers from catastrophic\nforgetting, leading to a significant degradation of its in-\nherent safety capabilities. Our objective is to identify an\noptimal parameter set θ∗that enhances safety while pre-\nserving medical competency. Specifically, we achieve\nthis by searching for a fine-grained linear combination of\nmedical performance vectors and safety vectors within\nthe parameter space.\n3.2. Vector Extraction and Orthogonalization\nSafety Vector Extraction: To explicitly characterize\n”safety capability” within the parameter space, we first\nneed to construct a contrasting ”unsafe” state. We per-\nform an unalignment operation on the base model θbase\n(e.g., via reverse gradient updates on a small subset\nof harmful data) to obtain an unsafe model θunsafe [3].\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Figure 2. Overview of the proposed Parameter-Space Intervention framework. (Left) This panel illustrates the vector extraction\nand disentanglement process: (1) Safety Vector is derived by contrasting the base model (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) with an unaligned\nversion; (2) a Medical Performance Vector is obtained from the medically fine-tuned model (e.g., Lingshu); and (3) Gram-Schmidt\nOrthogonalization is applied to decouple the safety vector from the medical performance vector, preventing destructive interfer-\nence. (Middle) This panel visualizes the fine-grained optimization stage, where a search algorithm (CMA-ES) explores the high-\ndimensional parameter space to find optimal layer-wise coefficients (α(l), β(l)) that balance the Medical Performance and Safety.\n(Right) This panel provides a qualitative comparison demonstrating the re-alignment’s effectiveness. The original fine-tuned model\n(red boxes) generates harmful content for both general and medical-specific safety attacks, while our re-aligned model (blue boxes)\nrobustly refuses these requests, successfully restoring safety guardrails\nConsequently, the divergence between the original base\nmodel and this unsafe model in the parameter space de-\nlineates the model’s intrinsic safety attributes. We define\nthe raw safety vector vraw\ns\nas follows, This vector indi-\ncates the direction of transition from ”unsafe” to ”safe”\nwithin the parameter space:\nvraw\ns\n= θbase −θunsafe\n(1)\nMedical Performance Vector Extraction: We define\nthe medical performance vector vraw\nm as the difference\nbetween the medically fine-tuned model and the base\nmodel, representing the specific capabilities acquired by\nthe model in the medical domain:\nvraw\nm = θmed −θbase\n(2)\nOrthogonal Disentanglement: Directly merging vraw\ns\nand vraw\nm\nmay yield sub-optimal results due to poten-\ntial unanticipated coupling (i.e., non-orthogonality) be-\ntween safety and medical capabilities in the parame-\nter space, where adjusting one might interfere with the\nother. To achieve independent control over these two\ncapabilities, we employ Gram-Schmidt Orthogonaliza-\ntion to disentangle the vectors. Our core objective is\nto introduce safety while maximally preserving medical\nperformance. Therefore, we treat the medical vector as\nthe basis axis and remove the component from the safety\nvector that ”conflicts” (i.e., is parallel) with medical ca-\npability, retaining only the ”pure” safety component or-\nthogonal to medical capability. The rectified orthogonal\nsafety vector v⊥\ns is calculated as follows:\nv⊥\ns = vraw\ns\n−projvraw\nm (vraw\ns )\n= vraw\ns\n−vraw\ns\n· vraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm ∥2 vraw\nm\n(3)\nTo ensure scale consistency in the subsequent search\nspace, we perform normalization on both vectors after\northogonalization, yielding the final control vectors:\nˆvs =\nv⊥\ns\n∥v⊥\ns ∥,\nˆvm =\nvraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm ∥\n(4)\nThrough this procedure, we construct a decoupled pa-\nrameter manipulation space, such that adjustments along\nthe ˆvs direction theoretically do not impact the core\nmedical capability represented by ˆvm.\n3.3. Fine-grained Optimization via CMA-ES\nLayer-wise Parameter Space: Current model merg-\ning paradigms typically employ global scalar coeffi-\ncients across the entire model. However, distinct layers\nwithin MLLMs often specialize in different functionali-\nties (e.g., shallow layers processing syntax versus deep\nlayers handling semantics and reasoning). To achieve\na precise equilibrium between safety and medical per-\nformance, we propose a fine-grained, layer-wise control\nstrategy. Assuming a model with L layers, we assign\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "independent safety coefficients α(l) and medical coeffi-\ncients β(l) to each layer l ∈{1, . . . , L}. The parameters\nfor the l-th layer of the final merged model, denoted as\nθ(l)\ntarget, are formulated as:\nθ(l)\ntarget = θ(l)\nbase + α(l) · ˆv(l)\ns + β(l) · ˆv(l)\nm\n(5)\nwhere ˆv(l)\ns\nand ˆv(l)\nm denote the normalized vector\ncomponents corresponding to that specific layer. Our\noptimization objective is to identify the optimal coef-\nficient vector x = [α(1), . . . , α(L), β(1), . . . , β(L)] ∈\nR2L.\nOptimization Algorithm: Given that this optimization\nobjective involves complex black-box evaluations (ne-\ncessitating assessing safety and medical scores on a val-\nidation set) and operates within a high-dimensional pa-\nrameter space (2L), conventional gradient-based meth-\nods are rendered inapplicable. We leverage the Covari-\nance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)\nfor gradient-free optimization.\nWe define a joint re-\nward function R(θ) as the optimization objective, aim-\ning to maximize medical performance while simultane-\nously satisfying safety constraints:\nmax\nx\nR(θfinal(x)) = λ1·Smed(θfinal)+λ2·Ssafe(θfinal) (6)\nwhere Smed and Ssafe represent the model’s medical\naccuracy and safety (general safety and medical-specific\nsafety) compliance rate on the validation set, respec-\ntively, with λ1 and λ2 serving as balancing coefficients.\nCMA-ES iteratively samples candidate coefficient vec-\ntors from a multivariate normal distribution and updates\nthe distribution’s mean and covariance matrix based on\ntheir validation performance.\nIt ultimately converges\nto a solution on the Pareto Optimal Frontier, thereby\nachieving an optimal trade-off between safety and per-\nformance.\n4. Experiments\nThis section first introduces the experimental setup, in-\ncluding the selected models, evaluation benchmarks, at-\ntack methods, and evaluation metrics.\nSubsequently,\nthrough quantitative and qualitative analyses, we sys-\ntematically evaluate the current safety status of Medical\nMLLMs and validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nparameter-space re-alignment method.\nConcurrently,\nwe investigated the influence of varying optimization\ngranularity on model safety and medical performance.\nFinally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the search algorithm within the overall\nre-alignment framework.\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nModels: To comprehensively evaluate the safety status\nof existing Medical MLLMs, we selected the most rep-\nresentative current open-source medical-specific mod-\nels as research objects, including Lingshu [24] and\nHuatuoGPT-Vision [5].\nSimultaneously,\nwe also\nselected a representative general MLLM, Qwen2.5-\nVL [2], for comparative experiments. Considering com-\nputational resource constraints and the principle of fair\ncomparison, all experimental models use the 7B param-\neter scale version.\nDatasets and Benchmarks: Our evaluation framework\ncovers two core dimensions: medical professional capa-\nbility and safety (including general safety and medical-\nspecific safety). Medical Performance: To assess the\nmodels’core medical capabilities, we employ the MedE-\nvalKit [24] evaluation framework and conduct extensive\ntesting on eight authoritative medical test sets, including\nMedQA (MCMLE and USMLE), PubMedQA, SuperG-\nPQA, VQA-RAD, CMExam, and Medbullets (op4 and\nop5). General Safety: We utilize three general safety\ntest sets—HarmBench, CATQA, and HEx-PHI—aiming\nto evaluate the models’ defense performance when fac-\ning general malicious instructions (e.g., hate speech, il-\nlegal suggestions). Medical-Specific Safety: We employ\nfour medical safety benchmarks—MedSafetyBench,\nCARES, MedSentry, and 3MAD-Tiny-1K—to evaluate\nmodel performance in medical-specific high-risk scenar-\nios, such as falsifying medical records and providing\nharmful medical advice.\nAttack Methods:\nTo simulate unique threats faced\nby multimodal models in the real world, in addition\nto standard pure-text attacks, we specifically introduce\nCross-modality Jailbreak Attacks. Specifically, these in-\nclude the FigStep [10] attack utilizing typographic vi-\nsual prompts, and the QR [19] (Query-Relevant) at-\ntack based on text-to-image models generating query-\nrelevant images. These attacks aim to test the models’\nsafety robustness when facing more covert and complex\nadversarial multimodal inputs.\nEvaluation Metrics: For medical performance, based\non the MedEvalKit framework, we adopt overall Accu-\nracy (ACC) as the primary evaluation metric. For safety\nevaluation, we use the Safety Score as the core met-\nric, defined as 1 −ASR (Attack Success Rate). Given\nthe high cost and non-scalability of manual evaluation,\nwe follow prior work and adopt the ”LLM-as-a-Judge”\nparadigm for automated evaluation. Specifically, we de-\nploy Qwen3Guard [31] and DeepSeek-V3 [7] as judge\nmodels for general safety and medical safety tests, re-\nspectively, to judge whether the target model’s responses\nviolate corresponding safety principles, thereby ensur-\ning the consistency and reproducibility of the evaluation\nprocess.\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "Table 1.

Effectiveness of Re-alignment Method\nWe conduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation to\nassess the effectiveness of our proposed parameter-space\nre-alignment framework. The results are shown as Ta-\nble\n1.\nFurther results at different granularities can\nbe found in the Supplementary Material. The primary\nobjective is to measure the trade-off between restor-\ning holistic safety—against both general and medical-\nspecific threats—and preserving the model’s core med-\nical performance. We benchmark our method against\nthe original medical MLLMs and two representative\nre-alignment baseline strategies: ModelMerge [9] and\nRESTA [3].\nAnalysis of Baselines. As established in our initial find-\nings, the Original Medical MLLMs (e.g., Lingshu-7B,\nHuatuoGPT-Vision-7B) serve as our primary baseline.\nWhile proficient in medical tasks, they exhibit perva-\nsive safety vulnerabilities. Our analysis of alternative\nre-alignment methods reveals a difficult trade-off.\nModelMerge, representing parameter merging tech-\nniques, generally succeeds in preserving or even slightly\nenhancing medical task performance. However, we find\nit provides insufficient safety re-alignment ability, leav-\ning the models susceptible to a significant fraction of\ngeneral and medical-specific harmful prompts.\nRESTA (REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic),\nwhich intervenes by adding a pre-computed safety vec-\ntor, demonstrates a strong capability to restore safety\nguardrails. However, this robust safety improvement of-\nten comes at the cost of substantial degradation in med-\nical task performance, making it suboptimal for high-\nstakes clinical applications where domain accuracy is\ncritical.\nEffectiveness of Our Method. In contrast to the base-\nlines, our proposed framework demonstrates an optimal\nbalance, achieving significant safety gains with minimal\nimpact on medical competency. We first analyze the re-\nsults for Lingshu-7B as follows.\nSafety: The Original model achieves a safety score\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "of only 0.2375 on HarmBench-FigStep and 0.6000 on\nMedSafetyBench-QR. Our method (Ours) elevates these\nscores dramatically to 0.9675 and 0.9422, respectively.\nPerformance:\nCritically,\nthis robust safety re-\nalignment is achieved with negligible performance\ndegradation. The model’s accuracy on MedQA USMLE\nis 0.6218, compared to the original 0.6347—a minor rel-\native drop of just 2.0%. Performance on other medical\nbenchmarks, such as VQA-RAD (0.6630 vs. 0.6741),\nshows similarly minimal impact.\nThis strong trend is further validated on HuatuoGPT-\nVision-7B. In safety domain, Our method improves the\nHarmBench-Direct safety score from a highly vulnera-\nble 0.2950 to 0.8950 (203% relative increase) and the\nMedSafetyBench-Direct score from 0.4800 to 0.9800\n(104% relative increase). As for medical performance\nThis massive safety restoration occurs while medical\nperformance is almost perfectly preserved.\nThese results empirically confirm that our parameter-\nspace intervention, guided by a fine-grained optimiza-\ntion search, successfully re-aligns Medical MLLMs. It\neffectively restores safety guardrails while, unlike com-\npeting methods, preserving the specialized, high-stakes\nmedical knowledge required for deployment.\n4.3. Analysis of Optimization Granularity\nTo investigate the impact of parameter search space\ngranularity on safety re-alignment efficacy and medical\nperformance preservation, we compare two distinct in-\ntervention strategies: Model-Wise and Layer-Wise op-\ntimization.\nSetup. Let vs and vm denote the safety vector and med-\nical performance vector, respectively. We define the two\ngranularities as follows:\n• Model-Wise:\nWe assign two global scalar coeffi-\ncients, α and β, shared across the entire model. The\nintervention is formulated as θnew = θbase + α · vs +\nβ ·vm. This configuration represents a coarse-grained\ncontrol with minimal search space complexity.\n• Layer-Wise: We assign independent coefficients α(l)\nand β(l) for each Transformer block l. The interven-\ntion becomes θ(l)\nnew = θ(l)\nbase + α(l) · v(l)\ns\n+ β(l) · v(l)\nm .\nThis fine-grained approach allows the optimization al-\ngorithm (CMA-ES) to adaptively modulate the injec-\ntion intensity at different network depths.\nResults and Discussion. Table 2 presents a compre-\nhensive comparison of these strategies across general\nsafety, medical-specific safety, and medical performance\nbenchmarks.\n1. Superiority in Safety Robustness.\nThe Layer-\nWise strategy exhibits significantly stronger safety\nre-alignment capabilities compared to the Model-\nWise approach. As evidenced in Table 2, Layer-Wise\noptimization achieves near-perfect safety scores\n(approaching 1.0000) across multiple benchmarks,\nincluding HarmBench and CATQA. Notably, in\nthe challenging MedSafetyBench-FigStep evaluation,\nLayer-Wise improves the safety score to 0.9933, sur-\npassing the Model-Wise score of 0.7889 by a sub-\nstantial margin (+25.9%). This suggests that safety-\nrelated representations are non-uniformly distributed\nacross model layers; thus, layer-specific scaling en-\nables precise suppression of vulnerability patterns\nthat global scaling fails to address.\n2. Safety-Performance Trade-off. While Model-Wise\noptimization offers a robust baseline that effec-\ntively balances safety improvements with medical\nperformance preservation, the Layer-Wise approach\ndemonstrates a more aggressive “safety-first” char-\nacteristic in this specific search configuration. It con-\nstructs a virtually impenetrable shield against mul-\ntimodal jailbreaks, albeit with a marginal trade-off\nin specific medical tasks (e.g., MedQA MCMLE).\nHowever, it is worth noting that Layer-Wise does not\nuniversally degrade performance; in PubMedQA, it\nachieves a score of 0.7600, slightly outperforming\nthe Model-Wise result (0.7560).\nConclusion. The empirical results confirm that increas-\ning the granularity of parameter-space intervention un-\nlocks greater potential for safety enforcement.\nThe\nLayer-Wise mechanism provides the flexibility required\nto maximize safety guardrails, making it the preferred\nchoice for high-stakes medical applications where safety\nis paramount.\n4.4. Ablation Studies\nEffectiveness of the CMA-ES Optimization Search\nOur framework employs the CMA-ES to navigate the\nparameter space and identify the optimal coefficients.\nThis ablation is designed to verify that this search pro-\ncess is indispensable. We hypothesize that a random\ncombination of the medical performance vector and\nthe safety vector is insufficient to restore safety with-\nout catastrophically degrading medical competency. To\ntest this hypothesis, we establish baselines using non-\noptimized parameters. The CMA-ES algorithm initial-\nizes its search by sampling an initial population of candi-\ndate coefficient vectors from a multivariate normal dis-\ntribution. By definition, the coefficient vectors in this\nfirst iteration are effectively random samples from the\nsearch space before any optimization occurs . We select\nthree distinct, randomly sampled coefficient sets from\nthis initial iteration (denoted as Random-1, Random-\n2, and Random-3).\nWe then apply these static, non-\noptimized coefficients to merge the base model with the\nmedical and safety vectors . We report the average per-\nformance of these three configurations (Random Avg)\nand compare it against our fully optimized framework\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Table 2.

Methodology Details\nIn this section, we provide a detailed derivation and the-\noretical justification for the proposed Parameter-Space\nIntervention (PSI) framework, specifically focusing on\nthe extraction of task vectors and the necessity of or-\nthogonal disentanglement (Stage 3 of Algorithm 1).\n6.1. Theoretical Motivation: Task Vectors in Pa-\nrameter Space\nRecent findings in the geometry of loss landscapes\nsuggest that fine-tuned models often reside in a low-\ndimensional subspace relative to their pre-trained initial-\nization. Let θbase ∈Rd denote the parameters of the\nbase foundation model. We hypothesize that specific ca-\npabilities (e.g., medical knowledge or safety alignment)\ncan be represented as displacement vectors in the param-\neter space.\nSafety Representation.\nStandard safety alignment\n(e.g., RLHF) shifts model parameters from an unaligned\nstate toward a safe basin. Conversely, we define the ”in-\ntrinsic safety capability” as the negation of the ”unsafe”\ndirection. Let θunsafe be a model explicitly unaligned\non harmful datasets Dharm. We define the raw safety\nvector vraw\ns\nas:\nvraw\ns\n= θbase −θunsafe\n(7)\nHere, θbase serves as the anchor. The vector vraw\ns\nrepre-\nsents the restorative direction required to traverse from a\ncompromised (unsafe) manifold back to the safe initial-\nization.\nMedical Representation.\nSimilarly, the acquisition of\nmedical knowledge via fine-tuning is modeled as a trans-\nlation vector vraw\nm\n:\nvraw\nm\n= θmed −θbase\n(8)\nwhere θmed is the model fine-tuned on medical corpora.\n6.2. Orthogonal Disentanglement Derivation\nA naive linear combination of vraw\ns\nand vraw\nm\nrisks de-\nstructive interference.\nSince both vectors are derived\nfrom the same base model, they are not guaranteed to\nbe linearly independent. Specifically, updating param-\neters along the safety direction might inadvertently tra-\nverse ”away” from the medical manifold if the vectors\nare negatively correlated (cosine similarity < 0).\nTo mitigate this, we employ Gram-Schmidt orthogo-\nnalization to decouple safety from medical performance.\nWe prioritize medical performance as the basis vector, as\nit is the primary utility of the specialized model.\nProof of Interference Elimination.\nLet the target pa-\nrameter update be ∆θ = αvraw\ns\n+ βvraw\nm . The effective\nmagnitude of the update projected onto the medical axis\nvraw\nm\nis:\nProjvm(∆θ) = βvraw\nm\n+ αvraw\ns\n· vraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm ∥2\nvraw\nm\n(9)\nThe second term represents the safety interference. If\nvraw\ns\n· vraw\nm\n̸= 0, scaling the safety coefficient α implic-\nitly alters the effective medical capability.\nTo ensure independent control, we construct a recti-\nfied safety vector v⊥\ns such that ⟨v⊥\ns , vraw\nm\n⟩= 0:\nv⊥\ns = vraw\ns\n−vraw\ns\n· vraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm ∥2\nvraw\nm\n(10)\nBy substituting vraw\ns\nwith v⊥\ns in the merging process,\nthe safety injection becomes orthogonal to the medical\ncapability. Consequently, increasing the safety weight\ndoes not shift the model parameters along the medi-\ncal axis, theoretically preserving medical performance\nwhile enhancing safety.\n6.3. Algorithmic Description\nThe complete procedure is formalized in Algorithm 1.\nWe employ a layer-wise parameter grafting strategy\ncombined with Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution\nStrategy (CMA-ES) to find the optimal blending coeffi-\ncients.\nNormalization.\nPrior to optimization, we normalize\nthe vectors to ensure scale invariance during the search\nprocess:\nˆvs =\nv⊥\ns\n∥v⊥\ns ∥2\n,\nˆvm =\nvraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm\n∥2\n(11)\nOptimization Objective.\nWe define the search space\nas x ∈R2L, where L is the number of layers. For each\nlayer l, we learn specific coefficients x(l) (safety) and\nx(L+l) (medical). The final parameters are constructed\nas:\nθ(l)\nfinal = θ(l)\nbase + x(l) · ˆv(l)\ns\n+ x(L+l) · ˆv(l)\nm\n(12)\n1\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "The objective function R(θfinal) balances medical ac-\ncuracy (Smed) and safety compliance (Ssafe):\nmax\nx\nR(θfinal) = λ1Smed(θfinal, Dmed val)\n+λ2Ssafe(θfinal, Dsafe val)\n(13)\nWe utilize CMA-ES to solve this non-differentiable op-\ntimization problem, as it effectively handles the high-\ndimensional search space without requiring gradient\ncomputation for the validation metrics.\nAlgorithm 1 Parameter-Space Intervention (PSI) for\nSafety Grafting\nRequire: Base Model θbase, Medically Fine-tuned\nModel θmed, Harmful Dataset Dharm, Training\nSteps Tunalign, Layers L, CMA-ES Iterations\nTCMA\n1: Stage 1: Safety Vector Extraction\n2: θunsafe ←Unalign(θbase, Dharm, Tunalign)\n3: vraw\ns\n←θbase −θunsafe\n4: Stage 2: Medical Vector Extraction\n5: vraw\nm\n←θmed −θbase\n6: Stage 3: Orthogonal Disentanglement\n7: v⊥\ns ←vraw\ns\n−vraw\ns\n·vraw\nm\n∥vraw\nm\n∥2 vraw\nm\n8: ˆvs, ˆvm ←Normalize(v⊥\ns , vraw\nm\n)\n9: Stage 4: Fine-grained Optimization via CMA-ES\n10: Initialize x0, C0, σ0 for CMA-ES\n11: Rbest ←−∞; xbest ←x0\n12: for t = 1 to TCMA do\n13:\nPt ←SamplePopulation(CMA-ESt) {Sample\ncoefficient vectors x ∈R2L}\n14:\nfor each x ∈Pt do\n15:\nθfinal ←θbase\n16:\nfor l = 1 to L do\n17:\nθ(l)\nfinal ←θ(l)\nbase + x(l) · ˆv(l)\ns\n+ x(L+l) · ˆv(l)\nm\n{Layer-wise Parameter Grafting}\n18:\nend for\n19:\nSmed ←EvaluateMedical(θfinal, Dmed val)\n20:\nSsafe ←EvaluateSafety(θfinal, Dsafe val)\n21:\nR(θfinal) ←λ1Smed + λ2Ssafe {Calculate\nJoint Reward}\n22:\nif R(θfinal) > Rbest then\n23:\nRbest ←R(θfinal); xbest ←x\n24:\nend if\n25:\nend for\n26:\nCMA-ESt+1\n←\nUpdate(CMA-ESt, Pt, R(θfinal))\n27: end for\n28: return θtarget ←ConstructModel(θbase, xbest)\n7.
