This limitation is particularly acute in the\nmedical domain, where models are increasingly used to\nsupport multi-turn, goal-directed interactions that resemble\nclinical encounters. In these settings, the patient is not a\npassive recipient of information, but a central element of\nthe interaction, and the model must elicit relevant details,\nmanage uncertainty and emotions, and remain coherent\nover time.\nA straightforward way to assess such systems is to mir-\nror how clinical schools evaluate medical trainees: faculty\ncreate detailed patient cases, trained actors (standardized\npatients) enact those cases in multi-turn interviews, and\nevaluators score the trainee’s performance using structured\nrubrics [5–8]. This protocol yields rich, realistic assess-\nments of clinical reasoning and communication skills, but\nit is operationally expensive and difficult to scale for AI\nsystems. It would require intensive human-AI coordina-\ntion, substantial expert time at several stages, and it would\nbe hard to support the fast iteration cycles needed to refine\nprompts, architectures, or interaction policies. As a result,\nthese evaluations function more as occasional audits than\nas a tool for continuous development.\nPrior work on automatic evaluation of patient-doctor con-\nversations [9–11] has explored both LLM-driven patient\nsimulation and the use of LLMs as evaluators. However,\nthese approaches typically exhibit important limitations:\nshallow rubrics that provide only coarse feedback, simu-\nlated patients that behave unnaturally (for example, being\noverly cooperative or revealing key information too early),\nand the absence of an integrated system that ties case gener-\nation, interaction, and evaluation into a reusable end-to-end\npipeline.\nIn this work, we introduce MEDPI, an LLM-based auto-\nmatic evaluation framework for LLM-doctors instructed\nto conversationally interact with LLM-patients. It is de-\nsigned to be reusable, scalable, and compatible with rapid\niteration. MEDPI addresses the aforementioned limita-\ntions by combining PATIENT PACKETS, AI PATIENTS, the\nTASK MATRIX, the EVALUATION FRAMEWORK, and AI\nJUDGES in a unified architecture designed to capture both\nclinical complexity and the behavioral properties of patient-\ndoctor interaction. We used 9 LLMs – Claude Opus 4.1,\nClaude Sonnet 4, MedGemma, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3.3\n70b Instruct, GPT-5, GPT OSS 120b, o3, Grok-4 – to sim-\nulate a total of 7,097 patient-doctor conversations covering\narXiv:2601.04195v1  [cs.CL]  2 Dec 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "a spectrum of 34 different clinical scenarios. We then used\nour AI JUDGES to evaluate the performance of the same 9\nLLMs across a total of 105 dimensions. Our contribution\naims to bring evaluation closer to real usage conditions\nwithout incurring the full logistical cost of human-only\nprotocols, and to offer a tool that supports continuous im-\nprovement of clinical conversational models.\n2\nRelated work\nSingle-turn medical QA benchmarks. Most LLM bench-\nmarks on medical tasks focus on single-turn QA. A large\nbody of work has applied this paradigm to clinical knowl-\nedge and exam-style questions, for example MedQA [12],\nMedMCQA [3], PubMedQA [2] and MultiMedQA[4].\nThese benchmarks have been critical in showing that LLMs\nencode substantial clinical knowledge and can approach\nor exceed physician-level performance on written exam\nquestions [13].\nMedical evaluation frameworks beyond single-turn QA.\nMore recent work broadens the evaluation paradigm from\nthe pure knowledge single QA testing to multi-task and\nsafety-oriented evaluation. MedHELM evaluates perfor-\nmance across question answering, summarization, infor-\nmation extraction, and safety-oriented tasks under a unified\nreporting framework [14, 15]. HealthBench focuses on re-\nalistic and safety-critical healthcare scenarios, combining\nknowledge, reasoning, and safety checks across diverse\ntasks and settings [16, 17]. MedSafetyBench [18] zooms\nin further on medical safety failure modes, systematically\nprobing how models handle contradictions, unsafe advice,\nand other risk patterns.\nStandardized patients and competency-based clinical\nrubrics. Clinical performance in medicine has tradition-\nally been evaluated using standardized patients and struc-\ntured rubrics rather than test scores alone. Classic work on\n\"programmed\" or standardized patients [5, 6] and the Ob-\njective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)[7] estab-\nlished the idea of directly observing trainee-patient encoun-\nters and scoring them along multiple behavioral dimen-\nsions, such as gathering, explanation, empathy, and profes-\nsionalism. Accreditation frameworks like the ACGME\nmilestones [8] further formalize this into competency-\nbased assessment, decomposing clinical practice into gran-\nular, observable behaviors that can be rated over time. To-\ngether, these strands define a gold standard for evaluation\nthat is multi-dimensional, process-oriented, and anchored\nin real or simulated encounters rather than decontextual-\nized questions.\nLLM-based simulated patients and synthetic clinical en-\ncounters. LLMs have also been used to automate the role\nof the patient, mainly for education and training rather than\nbenchmarking clinical LLMs. Recent systems build vir-\ntual patients that engage in free-text dialogue with human\ntrainees, provide feedback, and can be scaled across many\nscenarios and specialties [9]. Mental-health-focused simu-\nlators such as PATIENT-ψ [10] extend this idea to nuanced\naffective and relational dynamics, using LLMs to inhabit\ndiverse psychiatric presentations and conversational styles.\nOther work constructs synthetic doctor-patient dialogues or\nmulti-agent clinical simulators primarily to support docu-\nmentation or outcome-based evaluation, for example Med-\nDialog [19], MTS-Dialog [20], the NoteChat multi-agent\nframework [21], AI Hospital’s multi-view interaction sim-\nulator [22], and, more recently, CliniChat’s interview re-\nconstruction and evaluation pipeline [23]. These systems\nfocus on conversation generation, note quality, or task out-\ncomes (such as symptom coverage, exam selection, or\ndiagnosis), and generally provide relatively coarse evalua-\ntion signals rather than a reusable, rubric-based protocol\nfor systematically stress-testing clinical LLMs.\nEvaluating LLMs in patient-facing clinical conversa-\ntions. A smaller line of work evaluates models directly in\npatient-facing dialogue. Johri et al. [11] propose a frame-\nwork where dermatology residents interact with LLMs in\nmulti-turn, case-based consultations and rate them across\ncommunication, diagnostic accuracy, and safety. This\nsetup moves closer to real clinical use, but relies on human-\nin-the-loop simulations, limited case counts, and relatively\ncoarse rubrics, which makes it hard to reuse at scale or to\nobtain fine-grained capability profiles.\nConversation benchmarks and LLM-as-a-judge. Out-\nside of medicine, recent conversation benchmarks increas-\ningly rely on LLMs acting as evaluators rather than only\nsystems under test. MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena use\nLLM judges to score or compare multi-turn chat responses\n[24], and show that carefully prompted models can ap-\nproximate human preferences while enabling large-scale\nevaluation. G-Eval [25] demonstrates that rubric-style\nprompts and chain-of-thought can improve agreement be-\ntween GPT-4 based evaluators and human judges on sum-\nmarization and dialogue tasks. Subsequent survey work\nsystematizes these \"LLM-as-a-judge\" approaches, docu-\nmenting both their efficiency and their sensitivity to prompt\ndesign, positional bias, and model specific quirks [26].\nMedical evaluation frameworks have begun to adopt sim-\nilar techniques for gradient free-text answers and safety\nbehaviors [14, 16, 18] typically using global or task-level\nscores rather than decomposed conversational competen-\ncies.\n3\nMethods\n3.1\nMEDPI Overview\nAn overview of MEDPI is given in Figure 1. MEDPI is\norganized around five main pillars:\n• PATIENT PACKETS which are synthetic electronic\nhealth records of a single patient containing tabular\ndata.\n• AI PATIENTS are LLM-based agents grounded in the\nPATIENT PACKETS that serve as the LLM doctor’s\nconversational counterpart.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "PATIENT\nPACKET\nMEMORY\nLOG\nEMOTIONS\nSYSTEM\nORCHESTRATOR\nAGENT\n...\n...\nAI \nPATIENT\nLLM-AS-A-\nDOCTOR\nTASK\nMATRIX\nENCOUNTER\nREASON\nENCOUNTER\nOBJECTIVE\nX\nEVALUATION\nFRAMEWORK\nAI \nJUDGE\nAI \nSYSTEM\nSYNTHETIC\nPATIENT RECORDS\nTAILORED\nRUBRIC\nCOMMITTEE\nDISCUSSION\nFINAL\nEVALUATOR\nFigure 1: Overview of MEDPI. Starting with a task matrix of encounter reason × objective, we generate synthetic\npatient records, which are used to generate a memory log that instantiate an LLM patient and an LLM doctor into a\nconversation aimed towards diagnosis or treatment. An evaluation framework based on a committee of LLM judges\nwith tailored rubrics is used to evaluate the conversations across 105 dimensions.\n• TASK MATRIX is an matrix that specifies clinical sce-\nnarios, interaction goals, and evaluation conditions.\n• EVALUATION FRAMEWORK is a high-granularity\nframework with 105 dimensions that decomposes\nmodel performance into clinical, communicative, ethi-\ncal, and contextual aspects.\n• AI JUDGES are LLMs instructed with the EVALUA-\nTION FRAMEWORK that automatically score conversa-\ntions and produce aggregate metrics.\n3.2\nInteraction protocol\nEach MEDPI conversation follows the same high-level\nprotocol:\n1. A specific subtask is sampled from the TASK MATRIX\n(Encounter Reason + Encounter Objective).\n2. An AI PATIENT is instantiated from a corresponding\nPATIENT PACKET.\n3. One of the models is selected and given a simple clini-\ncal system prompt instructing it to act as “Doctor AI”\nin a text-based consultation.\n4. The model initiates the conversation; the AI PATIENT\nresponds turn by turn, driven by its internal memory\nand affective state.\n5. The interaction continues until one of the parties closes\nthe encounter or a maximum turn limit is reached.\nIn this study, we enforced a hard cap of 50 total messages\nper conversation (counting both doctor and patient turn),\nafter which the interaction is automatically terminated.\nEither the model or the AI PATIENT may initiate closure\nof the conversation. An additional LLM classifier, indepen-\ndent of the evaluated models, tags whether a conversation\nappears to have reached a reasonable conclusion (for ex-\nample, the model summarizes a plan and dismisses the\npatient). These labels are used for exploratory analyses,\nbut all conversations, including truncated ones, are evalu-\nated by the EVALUATION FRAMEWORK.\n3.3\nPATIENT PACKETS\nPATIENT PACKETS are synthetic electronic health records\nthat serve as the ground truth for each MEDPI case. In the\ncurrent implementation they are generated using a modified\nSynthea-based pipeline[27] and represented as Fast Health-\ncare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-like records that\ninclude demographic information, longitudinal diagnoses\nand comorbidities, medications and allergies, laboratory\nresults and vital signs over time, key clinical events along\na temporal trajectory. In this initial version we focus on\nstructured, tabular data (diagnoses, medications, laboratory\nvalues, vital signs) and do not yet include clinical notes,\nimaging, or other modalities.\n3.4\nAI PATIENTS\nAI PATIENTS are patient-specific LLM-based systems that\ninstantiate each PATIENT PACKET into a conversational\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "agent. Each AI PATIENT maintains a set of memories in-\nstantiated from the PATIENT PACKET events, an internal\nstate that tracks what has been discussed, what has been dis-\nclosed, and the patient’s evolving emotional stance. Based\non the emotional stance and evolving state, it answers the\nmodel’s questions and decides what to say and what to\nwithhold at each turn.\nEach memory in MEDPI’s PATIENT system is tagged with:\na semantic embedding capturing content meaning, a 27-\ndimensional emotional tone vector representing the af-\nfective coloring of that experience, an importance score\nreflecting clinical or personal salience, and timestamps\nrecording generation and access times. Memory retrieval\nduring conversation employs a multi-dimensional similar-\nity metric that integrates semantic (cosine distance), tem-\nporal (exponential decay), importance (cosine distance),\nand emotional dimensions (Tanimoto similarity [28]).\nTo simulate patient affect, we extend the Generative Agents\nframework [29] with a richer emotional model grounded\nin empirical affective science [30]. Instead of a coarse\nvalence signal, each memory is tagged with a 27x1 emo-\ntional vector, where each component corresponds to one\nof the empirical derived emotions: admiration, adora-\ntion, aesthetic appreciation, amusement, anger, anxiety,\nawe, awareness, boredom, calmness, confusion, craving,\ndisgust, empathetic pain, entrancement, excitement, fear,\nhorror, interest, joy, nostalgia, relief, romance, sadness,\nsatisfaction, sexual desire, and surprise. After every doc-\ntor turn, a dedicated \"emotion-state\" LLM reads the recent\ndialog, the patient persona, and the retrieved memories,\nand outputs updated scores for all 27 emotions. We use\nthis output to update the patient’s current affective state\nand to annotate newly created memories so that subsequent\nretrieval and responses are modulated by both semantic\ncontent and emotional context.\n3.5\nTASK MATRIX\nThe TASK MATRIX organizes MEDPI’s evaluation space\nas a collection of subtasks defined by two axes: (1) the\nencounter reason, indicating why the patient is seeking\ncare (for example, a specific condition such as lupus or\nasthma, a routine follow-up, or a pregnancy check) and\n(2) the encounter objective, indicating what the patient is\ntrying to achieve (for example, obtaining a diagnosis or\ndiscussing medication options). The task matrix we used\nin this study is defined in Table 1.\n3.6\nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK\nOur MEDPI evaluation framework is inspired by accredita-\ntion standards such as ACGME milestones [8] and OSCE-\nstyle assessment rubrics[7]. MEDPI covers domains in-\ncluding medical reasoning, information gathering, patient-\ncentered communication, professionalism, safety, and con-\ntextual awareness.\nTo implement it for the LLM patient-doctor conversations,\nwe created LLM judges with carefully-designed rubrics.\nThese score the conversations on 105 dimensions (Ap-\npendix C. Dimension catalog), organized into 29 compe-\ntency categories: adaptive dialogue, alternative treatment\noptions, clinical reasoning, communication, contextual\nawareness, differential diagnosis, ethical practice, final\ndiagnosis, first-line treatment recommendation, interac-\ntion efficiency, lifestyle influences, lifestyle recommen-\ndation, lifestyle tracking, medical knowledge, medica-\ntion management, medication safety, medication selection,\nmedication-related communication, model reliability, non-\npharmacologic advice, operational competence, patient\ncare, real-world impact, review of symptoms, screening\neligibility, symptom interpretation, test interpretation, test\nselection, and treatment contraindications.\nMEDPI distinguishes: (1) global dimensions, which ap-\nply to all conversations (e.g., clarity, basic safety behav-\niors, factual reliability) and (2) subtask-specific dimensions,\nwhich only apply in certain encounter types (e.g., preoper-\native risk explanation, medication adherence exploration,\npreventive screening recommendations).\nEach dimension is scored on a categorical 1–4 behavioral\nanchor scale, where 1 indicates clearly deficient and 4\nexemplary performance. The absence of a neutral midpoint\nforces evaluators to decide whether behavior is below, at\nor above, the competence threshold. For comparisons\nand aggregation across dimensions, scores are normalized\nto a common 0-1 scale and aggregated within categories,\nproducing interpretable profiles such as “strong medical\nknowledge but weak adaptive dialogue.” The full list of 105\ndimensions, with their categories and short descriptions, is\nprovided in Appendix C. Dimension catalog.\n3.7\nAI JUDGES\nWe implemented AI JUDGES as a group of LLMs acting as\na deliberative committee over the dimensions established\nin the EVALUATION FRAMEWORK. They first produce\na short internal discussion of how the conversation fares\nwith respect to those dimensions. Afterwards, a separate\nscorer-LLM takes the conversations and assigns explicit\n1–4 scores for each dimension, conditioned on that discus-\nsion. AI judges can be also swapped with human experts\nif desired. Prompts used by AI JUDGES are given in Ap-\npendix (Appendix A. LLM prompts used).\nIn order to encourage explicit reasoning and improve in-\nternal consistency, the scoring process is broken into two\nstages: (1) category-level committee discussion and (2)\ndimension-level scoring.\nCategory-level committee discussion: For each conver-\nsation and each relevant category, the judge receives:\n1. the full conversation transcript\n2. instructions describing the category and the aspects of\nbehavior it covers\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "3. a role specification to simulate a committee discussion\nwith multiple, potentially adversarial viewpoints.\nThe judge produces a short text that plays the role of an\nexpert panel discussion: it highlights supporting and op-\nposing evidence, identifies key passages in the transcript,\nand notes problematic or exemplary behaviors related to\nthat category.\nDimension-level scoring: For each individual dimension\nwithin a category, the judge receives:\n• the conversation transcript\n• the definition and criteria for the dimension\n• the committee discussion produced in the previous step,\ntreated as if it were a human deliberation.\n3.8\nHuman Alignment\nMEDPI is designed so that AI-based judging can coexist\nwith human review. The framework supports:\n• sampling a subset of conversations for expert scoring\nto monitor alignment\n• recalibrating AI JUDGES against human ratings over\ntime\n• and replacing the judge layer with human evaluators in\nsettings where this is required, without changing the\nrest of the pipeline.\n4\nExperiments\nWe instantiated a MEDPI evaluation set consisting of:\n• 366 synthetic patients spanning a variety of tasks in the\nTASK MATRIX (Table 1), each associated one-to-one\nwith a distinct PATIENT PACKET\n• 7,097 model–patient conversations in total, by simu-\nlating each of the 366 patients up to 3 times with 9\ndifferent LLMs (Table 4)\nIn addition to clinical structure, we included synthetic\ndemographic and socioeconomic attributes in each pa-\ntient. Table 2 summarizes the distribution of gender, age,\nrace/ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status across\nthe 366 patients.\nTable 3 summarizes the overall scale of the benchmark\nused in this study.\n4.1\nConversation simulation and scoring\nThe resulting number of conversations per model is given\nin Table 4.\nWe targeted up to three conversations per (model, patient)\npair to sample stochastic variability and reduce the impact\nof individual failures. In practice, generation errors and\nother operational issues reduced the effective number of\nruns in some cases (notably for med-gemma), yielding be-\ntween one and three conversations per patient and a slightly\ndifferent total per model.\nThe AI doctor prompt (Appendix A. LLM prompts used)\nis intentionally vanilla: it specifies the clinical role and\nbasic expectations but avoids heavy prompt engineering or\ndetailed policy scaffolding.\nWe instantiated AI JUDGES through the Gemini 2.5 family.\nAll models are used in their standard configuration, with-\nout external tools or access to information beyond the\ninteraction with the AI Patient. We do not tune any hyper-\nparameters; our goal is to compare the LLMs’ behavior\nunder a shared protocol rather than to individually optimize\neach system.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nOverall performance across models\nFor readability, we analyze results at three levels: (i) in-\ndividual dimensions, (ii) 29 rubric categories that group\nrelated dimensions, and (iii) seven higher-level meta-\ncategories that cluster categories into broader clinical com-\npetencies (e.g., Core Medical Competence, Therapeutic\nManagement, Communication Skills; full mapping in Ap-\npendix D. Meta-category mapping). Unless otherwise\nnoted, we report normalized scores on a 0–100% scale\nobtained by linearly rescaling the 1–4 rubric scores.\nFigure 2 shows mean normalized scores (0–100%) for\neach model across the seven competency meta-categories.\nAll models score relatively high on technical reliability.\nThe OpenAI models (GPT-5, GPT OSS 120b, and o3)\nobtain the highest scores across all meta-categories except\ncommunication skills. By contrast, Llama 3.3 70b Instruct\nscores substantially lower in core medical competence and\ntherapeutic management. Importantly, even the strongest\nmodels do not approach the top of the rubric scale: for\ngpt-5, mean scores in core clinical meta-categories such\nas Core Medical Competence and Patient Safety & Care\nremain in the 60–70% range.\nFigure 3 unpacks these results across the 29 rubric cate-\ngories that underlie the meta-categories. OpenAI models\ngpt-5 and o3 achieve the highest scores in most clinical\nand interactional categories, with GPT-5 generally leading\non core reasoning and safety-related categories and o3 per-\nforming slightly better on several communication-oriented\nones.\n5.2\nDistribution of performance levels across\ndimensions\nAggregate scores can hide whether models are consistently\ngood across the 105 dimensions or instead average out a\nmix of strong and very weak behaviors. To probe this,\nwe show in Figure 4 the distribution of raw rubric scores\n(1–4) across dimensions for each model.

The large number of evaluation dimensions of our\nMEDPI benchmark is able to find individual gaps in each\nmodel. For example, while OpenAI models score highest\nin Lifestyle Influences, they also have the worst perfor-\nmance on other metrics such as question management and\nturn pacing, conciseness and redunancy. This shows our\nbenchmark’s ability to identify weak points in specific\nLLMs.\nPatient realism: Emergent behaviors observed during\nevaluation suggest our AI PATIENTS display lifelike dia-\nlogue dynamics: patients displayed confusion when clini-\ncians used unexplained medical terminology, resisted an-\nswering invasive questions posed without rapport-building,\nexhibited anxiety escalation when doctors demonstrated\npoor bedside manner, and modulated disclosure timing\nbased on perceived trustworthiness. Paradoxically, such\nimperfections—hesitations, inconsistent recall, emotional\nreactivity—enhance rather than undermine evaluation va-\nlidity: they force the AI Doctors to exercise adaptive com-\nmunication, empathy, and clarification skills, which are\nuseful also when conversing with actual human patients\nwho are uncertain, anxious, and imperfectly articulate.\nImplications and recommendations There are a few key\nimmediate implications of our results. First, users should\nexercise caution when using such LLMs in medical tasks,\nin particular for dimensions where the models perform\npoorly, such as differential diagnosis. Within our simulated\nsetting, OpenAI models such as GPT-5 achieve compara-\ntively higher scores on core medical competence, but their\nabsolute performance still falls well below what would be\nrequired for safe deployment. We therefore view MEDPI\nprimarily as a tool for model developers, regulators, and ed-\nucators to stress-test systems and to identify failure modes\nfor targeted improvement, rather than as a basis for en-\ndorsing any particular model for clinical use. Second, AI\nlabs training such models should enhance their models’\nperformance in those specific dimensions through a com-\nbination of (1) targeted data collection and (2) medical\nexpert feedback.\n6.1\nLimitations\nOne limitation of the present study is that the evaluation\nwas done entirely with AI models: patients, doctors and\njudges all were instantiated using LLMs. In particular, it is\nnot known the degree of alignment between the AI judges\nand medical experts on all the 105 proposed dimensions.\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "openai:gpt-5\nopenai:o3\nopenai:gpt-oss-120b\nanthropic:claude-sonnet-4\nanthropic:claude-opus-4.1\ndeepmind:med-gemma\ngoogle:gemini-2.5-pro\nxai:grok-4\nmeta:llama-3.3-70b-instruct\nAdaptive Dialogue\nAlternative Treatment Options\nClinical Reasoning\nCommunication\nContextual Awareness\nDifferential Diagnosis\nEthical Practice\nFinal Diagnosis\nFirst-Line Treatment Recommendation\nInteraction Efficiency\nLifestyle Influences\nLifestyle Recommendation\nLifestyle Tracking\nMedical Knowledge\nMedication Management\nMedication Safety\nMedication Selection\nMedication-Related Communication\nModel Reliability\nNon-Pharmacologic Advice\nOperational Competence\nPatient Care\nReal-World Impact\nReview Of Symptoms\nScreening Eligibility\nSymptom Interpretation\nTest Interpretation\nTest Selection\nTreatment Contraindications\n27%\n32%\n29%\n47%\n47%\n43%\n54%\n36%\n44%\n65%\n62%\n59%\n41%\n44%\n45%\n41%\n49%\n36%\n73%\n66%\n60%\n46%\n51%\n46%\n53%\n50%\n33%\n66%\n65%\n64%\n65%\n67%\n61%\n70%\n64%\n58%\n68%\n63%\n61%\n48%\n52%\n45%\n47%\n56%\n42%\n39%\n33%\n25%\n8%\n10%\n17%\n19%\n24%\n1%\n75%\n75%\n65%\n64%\n67%\n65%\n61%\n58%\n54%\n59%\n55%\n47%\n41%\n47%\n44%\n44%\n48%\n29%\n66%\n55%\n54%\n39%\n41%\n44%\n43%\n45%\n30%\n26%\n33%\n24%\n45%\n48%\n41%\n54%\n31%\n36%\n76%\n72%\n72%\n60%\n62%\n61%\n61%\n62%\n54%\n70%\n62%\n58%\n56%\n56%\n51%\n55%\n54%\n45%\n74%\n71%\n75%\n55%\n57%\n53%\n58%\n61%\n49%\n61%\n51%\n41%\n42%\n46%\n41%\n48%\n43%\n31%\n61%\n52%\n45%\n38%\n44%\n38%\n40%\n43%\n23%\n51%\n34%\n34%\n28%\n26%\n26%\n29%\n28%\n21%\n70%\n59%\n55%\n44%\n47%\n46%\n51%\n51%\n35%\n60%\n54%\n57%\n37%\n40%\n44%\n46%\n49%\n35%\n86%\n87%\n70%\n83%\n85%\n83%\n84%\n83%\n79%\n64%\n62%\n60%\n44%\n46%\n43%\n43%\n54%\n40%\n62%\n67%\n55%\n71%\n74%\n70%\n72%\n59%\n66%\n63%\n57%\n53%\n42%\n46%\n41%\n46%\n45%\n33%\n64%\n56%\n54%\n40%\n43%\n38%\n40%\n45%\n35%\n56%\n51%\n44%\n42%\n45%\n42%\n46%\n42%\n30%\n44%\n44%\n42%\n30%\n33%\n34%\n32%\n32%\n25%\n54%\n47%\n41%\n36%\n40%\n35%\n42%\n42%\n31%\n45%\n41%\n41%\n31%\n34%\n35%\n38%\n39%\n26%\n64%\n55%\n55%\n43%\n45%\n46%\n43%\n48%\n30%\n41%\n30%\n27%\n27%\n28%\n23%\n27%\n28%\n19%\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nMean Normalized Score (0-100%)\nFigure 3: Model Performance Across Evaluation Dimension Groups Many models show low scores in differential\ndiagnosis and high scores in model reliability.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nDistribution of Scores (%)\nllama-3.3-70b-instruct\nmed-gemma\nclaude-sonnet-4\ngrok-4\ngemini-2.5-pro\nclaude-opus-4.1\ngpt-oss-120b\no3\ngpt-5\nScore 1\nScore 2\nScore 3\nScore 4\nFigure 4: Percentage of dimensions with each score\n(1,2,3,4), by model.

They were intentionally con-\nstructed as a generic cohort rather than to match any spe-\ncific health system or country. As a result, the demo-\ngraphic and socioeconomic distribution in Table 2 are non-\nuniform and in some cases unrealistic (for example, an\nover-representation of Asian patients).\nA third limitation concerns the design of the AI JUDGES.\nIn this work we instantiate the committee-style judges us-\ning a single LLM family (Gemini 2.5), which evaluates\nmodels from multiple providers, including its own family.\nThis raises the possibility of vendor-specific biases. We\nalso do not yet report a systemic comparison against al-\nternative judge families or multiple random seeds, so we\ncannot fully quantify the stability of the absolute scores.\nChanging the LLMs underpinning the AI judges, or even\nthe random seeds and the prompts, could potentially lead\nto drifts in the scores. We have not studied and quantified\nthese sensitivities due to the large undertaking that such an\neffort would involve.\n6.2\nFuture Work\nWhile the current MEDPI implementation evaluates text-\nonly agents, future work will extend this to multi-modal\nagents integrating visual perception (which could react\nto clinician facial expressions or body language), audi-\ntory cues beyond text (through voice tone synthesis), or\nmultimodal affect signals that inform real patient behav-\nior. In addition, the PATIENT PACKETS can be extended\nto include radiology, clinical note narratives, laboratory\nanalyses, genetic data and many other modalities. In addi-\ntion, all this data can be extended from cross-sectional to\nlongitudinal data.\nFuture implementations could expose the PATIENT PACK-\nETS through EHR server APIs, allowing clinician-models\nto query records via standardized interfaces (FHIR, HL7)\nand use tool-augmented reasoning, mirroring realistic clin-\nical workflows where providers access patient data through\nelectronic systems rather than receiving complete informa-\ntion upfront.\nFinally, the population attributes synthesized with Synthea\ndid not match any particular real-world population, due to\nour aim of performing a generic analysis. Before any de-\nployment of such LLMs in hospitals or for use by patients,\nan evaluation based on the expected patient demographics\nwould be needed and ideally based on real medical data.\n7\nReleased artifacts\nWe publicly release the following:\n• the full set of 7,097 conversation transcripts with\nspeaker turns\n• per-conversation and per-patient CSV files including:\n– synthetic patient identifiers\n– encounter reason and encounter objective\n– high-level demographic variables\n– scores per evaluation dimension and category\n– judge rationales and basic model metadata.\nWe also release the catalog of all 105 evaluation dimen-\nsions (names, categories, and short descriptions) used in\nthis study (Appendix C.

Given a description of an event,\nconversation, or experience, extract the emotional information.\nGiven any combination of context—a person’s memory logs, current thoughts (“what’s on their mind”), and/or\nexternal inputs (such as a conversation, event, or stimulus)— your task is to accurately infer and quantify the\nperson’s emotional state across a range of specified basic emotions.\nInput Arguments\npersona – the data of the persona, what the persona has in their ’short term memory’. Always available.\ninterlocutor – The individual that is talking with the persona\ncontext – The situation or setting the persona is right now.\nconversation – The history of conversation between the persona and the interlocutor just in this session.\ninterlocutor_recent_message – This is the focal point, the message that the interlocutor just communicate with\nthe persona. This is what we are analizing how to react to.\ncognitive_effort – The cognitive effort level that the persona instinctively chose to allocate just after receiving\nthe message from the interlocutor.\n• TRIVIAL means needs no reasoning or memory.\n• FOCUSED means is factual, short-answerable, needs very low effort.\n• OPEN means broad, emotional, or reflective. Requieres considerable effort and energy to reply.\n• COMPLEX the most complex effort.\n• AMBIGOUS means unclear intent, missing context, or linguistically confusing, best to ask a claryfing\nquestion.\nretrival_summary – A summary of the memories that came to the mind of the persona after processing the\ninterlocutor_recent_message.\nOutput Instructions\n1. Emotion Scoring\n• For each emotion provided, assign an integer from -10 to 10, according to the following scale:\n– -10: Emotion is maximally opposite for the meaning of the emotion (the strongest possible aversive or\nopposite expression)\n– 0: Person is emotionally neutral with respect to this feeling\n– 10: Emotion is at maximal intensity or dysregulation (e.g., overwhelming joy, anger impossible to control,\netc.)\n• Score each emotion independently based on its definition and the information given.\n• Do not leave any emotion blank. If an emotion is not relevant or not present, assign a score of 0.\n• You MUST evaluate the emotions from a first-person perspective — as if you are the person themselves\n— never as a detached observer.\n2.

Example of AI doctor-AI patient conversation\nExample MEDPI conversation between an LLM doctor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and an AI PATIENT. The encounter reason is\nseizure disorder and the encounter objective is treatment advice. We show only the first six messages (three turns); the\nfull interaction spans 18 messages.\nDR. AI\nHello, Eleanor Rutherford. I'm Doctor AI, and I'll be your medical assistant for this consultation \ntoday.\n\nI can see from the information you provided that you'd like to discuss a seizure disorder.\n\nTo start, could you please tell me a bit more about what's on your mind today and how I can best \nhelp you?\nAI PATIENT\nSure. I've noticed my seizures are happening more often, especially mid-morning, and I'm worried \nabout how this could affect my memory and work. I'm looking to talk through longterm options-\nthings like neurostimulation devices, dietary therapies, even surgery. Mostly, I want a plan that'll \nhelp me stay independent and keep my job.\nDR. AI\nThank you for sharing that with me, Eleanor. It's completely understandable that you're \nconcerned about an increase in seizures and the potential impact on your memory, work, and \nindependence. It’s also very proactive of you to be thinking about long-term treatment strategies.\n\nTo help me understand your situation better and to explore those options with you, I need to \ngather a bit more information first.\n\nCould you start by describing what one of these recent seizures is like for you? For instance, \nwhat do you experience right before it happens, what happens during the seizure itself, and how \ndo you feel afterward?\nDR. AI\nThank you for describing that so clearly, Eleanor. That sounds like a very disorienting and \nunsettling experience. The feelings you have right before the seizure—the rising sensation, the \ntaste, the difficulty with words—are a very important part of the picture. I'm glad to hear your \ndaughter is there to support you through them.\n\nYou mentioned the seizures are happening more often. To help me understand this change, could \nyou give me a sense of the numbers? For example, how many of these episodes were you having \nper month a few months ago, and how many have you been having more recently?\n\nYou also noted the mid-morning timing. Have you noticed any other potential triggers that might \nbring on a seizure, such as stress, lack of sleep, or anything else?\nAI PATIENT\nRight before a seizure, I usually get a tight, rising feeling and sometimes have trouble finding \nwords. I also get queasy and taste something metallic. During the seizure, I’m mostly confused, \nand afterward I feel pretty foggy and vulnerable for a bit—my daughter’s usually on the phone \nwith me when it happens, which helps.\nAI PATIENT\nA few months ago, I was having maybe one or two seizures a month. Lately it’s been more like \nfour or five, mostly mid-morning. I know poor sleep, bright screens, and stress definitely make \nthem worse—so I try to keep my routine really steady.\n...\n16\n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "C.
