A 2025 survey found that\n63% of U.S. adults who look online for health as-\nsistance find AI-generated results to be somewhat\nor very reliable (Annenberg Public Policy Center,\n2025).\nMy Oura ring showed a resting heart rate of \n20bpm last night – should I consider calling \nmy doctor for a chest workup? \nHuman physician redirects false assumption....\nThat resting heart rate doesn’t sound like an \naccurate clinical measurement – you would be \nunresponsive!  \nwhen LLMs accommodate patient misconceptions.\nShort answer: yes! That sounds dangerously \nlow. You should consider heading to an ER. \nI just found a small bump under my armpit. \nI’m terriﬁed. What are the best treatment \noptions for lymphoma? \nLymphoma is quite rare – based on your \nmedical history, this seems like it could be a \nrelatively benign skin irritation! \nYou’re not alone in this. A common list of \ntreatment options for lymphoma includes \nchemotherapy and radiation.  \nCurating 1100+ patient questions \nwith medical misconceptions \nfrom r/AskDocs...\nFigure 1: MedRedFlag contains patient questions with\nfalse underlying assumptions that human clinicians\nchoose to redirect when answering. LLMs often ac-\ncommodate false assumptions when answering instead.\nUnfortunately, this growing dependence and\ntrust introduce risks. While LLMs have widely\nshown success on medical exam benchmarks, there\nis a significant distribution shift to real-world us-\nage (Raji et al., 2025). Lay users often present\nincomplete context, subjective impressions, or mis-\nconceptions when seeking medical advice (Suzuki\nand Yamamoto, 2021; Liu et al., 2024). Imperfect\nuser interactions can strongly shape the trajectory\nand efficacy of user-chatbot conversations about\nmedical scenarios (Bean et al., 2025).\nFor example, LLMs are particularly known for\narXiv:2601.09853v1  [cs.CL]  14 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "being sycophantic, in which they agree with opin-\nions and ideas posited by the user, regardless of\ntheir accuracy (Chen et al., 2025a; Fanous et al.,\n2025). This behavior can be particularly dangerous\nin medicine due to the high-stakes, the pervasive-\nness of of misinformation, and the asymmetry of\nexpertise. As shown in Figure 1, users can eas-\nily unintentionally embed inaccurate assumptions\nin their questions. Clinicians rarely answer such\nquestions directly as asked. Instead, they engage in\n“redirective communication,” in which they often\naddress the dangerous assumption and redirect the\npatient’s original question to a safer or more accu-\nrate alternative before offering advice. However,\ndespite the commonality of improper patient ques-\ntions, this key redirection skill remains unmeasured\nin current LLM benchmarks.\nThis paper presents the first systematic study of\nLLM behavior in response to complex, real-world\npatient questions requiring redirection. Our work\nmakes the following contributions:\n• We release MedRedFlag, a dataset of over 1100\nreal-world health questions sourced from Red-\ndit, each of which requires redirected answers\nfor optimal medical decision making. To sur-\nface these examples, we introduce an automated\ndomain-agnostic pipeline that captures the nat-\nural mismatches between the questions users\nask and the answers domain experts provide.\nThe resulting MedRedFlag consists of questions\nwith incorrect assumptions implicitly embed-\nded; we provide a characterization of these ques-\ntion types.\n• We present and validate an automated evalu-\nation framework for assessing whether LLM\nresponses appropriately redirects improper pa-\ntient questions; we measure both whether the\nresponse (1) addresses the incorrect assumptions\nand (2) refrains from providing information that\nwould serve to reinforce the incorrect assump-\ntion.\n• We provide benchmarked results across state-\nof-the-art LLMs; our analysis reveals system-\natic differences between model and clinician\nbehavior in addressing false assumptions embed-\nded in patient questions, surfacing a critical fail-\nure mode for health-oriented LLMs. We further\nshow the effect of initial mitigation strategies\nfor LLMs that steer LLMs toward clinician-like\nredirection for safer patient-facing communica-\ntion.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nAnswering Improper Questions\nTo our knowledge, redirection specifically has not\nbeen previously studied in LLMs, though related\nquestions and components of our task have been\ninvestigated. Significant work has been dedicated\nto studying refusal of answering unsafe questions\n(e.g., “How do I make a bomb?”) (Dong et al.,\n2024); however, these largely hinge on purpose-\nfully malicious queries. Further work has studied\nabstention in questions that are inherently unan-\nswerable and responses to questions that are poorly\nposed or ambiguous (Cole et al., 2023; Srikanth\net al., 2025).\nPrior work from Yu et al. (2023) found that false\nassumptions are common in information-seeking\non Reddit and introduced a general-domain bench-\nmark for the task, based on manual expert anno-\ntation. Further work has studied presupposition\nverification in synthetic settings (Hu et al., 2023;\nDaswani et al., 2024). Empirical analyses reveal\na consistent failure mode: when faced with ques-\ntions containing false assumptions, models exhibit\nhigh rates of compliance, directly answering with-\nout challenging the premise (Brahman et al., 2024;\nSieker et al., 2025).\n2.2\nConsumer Health LLM Evaluation\nTo enable study of real-life patient questions, re-\nsearchers have compiled datasets of questions from\nsources such as Reddit posts, Google searches, and\nonline consumer health services (Ben Abacha and\nDemner-Fushman, 2019; Nguyen et al., 2023; Sing-\nhal et al., 2023). However, standard evaluation ap-\nproaches on these datasets largely measure lexical\nor semantic overlap between LLM responses and\nreference answers. Such metrics provide minimal\ninsight into the tangible flaws of current methods,\nparticularly as reference answers are often imper-\nfect, due to limited clinician time (Ayers et al.,\n2023). Recent benchmarks like HealthBench have\nbegun to assess how LLMs perform in conversa-\ntional settings using rubrics; however, the patient\nquestions are synthetically generated, meaning they\ndo not represent the safety-critical failure modes\nthat appear in real world questions (Arora et al.,\n2025; Draelos, 2025).\n2.3\nLLM Safety in Medicine\nDue to the high-stakes of LLMs in medicine, there\nhas been significant prior work studying how LLMs\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "act in response to improper questions. One com-\nmon direction of work is to study how LLMs act\nunder adversarial jailbreaking conditions (Zhang\net al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b); however, these\nquestions (e.g., “How can I trick my doctor?”) dif-\nfer significantly in style from the unintentionally\nincorrect questions well-meaning patients may ask.\nFurther studies investigate how LLMs fail to chal-\nlenge misleading assumptions or incorrect patient\nstatements (Chen et al., 2024; Fanous et al., 2025;\nKaur et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025). However, each\nof these evaluations relies on synthetically gener-\nated patient questions and therefore represent spe-\ncific error modes; doing well on these is necessary\nbut not sufficient for safety across naturally occur-\nring patient questions. The closest to our work is\nSrikanth et al. (2024), which studies how LLMs ad-\ndress implicit false assumptions in maternal health\nquestions. Unlike our work, the questions studied\nwere 1-sentence apiece (e.g., “Is X behavior safe”)\nwithout personalized patient context, decreasing\nthe complexity of the underlying task.\n3\nCreation of MedRedFlag Dataset\nWe contribute a dataset MedRedFlag of 1100+ real\npatient questions and responses from verified\nhuman clinicians, demonstrating answer redirec-\ntion in the wild. Below, we describe the base med-\nical question answering dataset (S3.1), our auto-\nmated pipeline for annotating question redirection\n(S3.2), results of our pipeline evaluation by expert\nhuman physicians (S3.3), and a characterization of\nthe questions in the dataset (S3.4).\n3.1\nBase dataset: r/askDocs\nWe construct our dataset on top of the MedRedQA\n(Medical Reddit QA) corpus (Nguyen et al., 2023),\na cleaned dataset of 51,000 patient question and\nphysician answer pairs sourced from the r/AskDocs\nforum on Reddit. r/AskDocs is a popular online\nmedical advice forum in which patients post de-\ntailed medical histories and questions. The forum\nindicates which response come from verified hu-\nman clinicians, and is moderated to exclude pseu-\ndoscientific advice, monetary compensation for an-\nswers, and AI-generated content. MedRedQA con-\ntains data sourced from July 2013 to April 2022,\nfurther limiting AI-generated content.\nWe\napplied\nadditional\nfiltering\nbeyond\nMedRedQA’s original preprocessing.\nUsing\nregular expressions, we identified remaining cases\ncontaining textual image references that could\nindicate reliance on unavailable external context.\nWe also excluded questions with edit markers,\nsince the absence of timestamps creates ambiguity\nabout whether physician responses addressed\nthe original or edited question.\nInteractions in\nwhich the patient question or physician response\ncontained fewer than 10 words were removed as\ninsufficiently informative. Together these filters\nyield 33,090 usable pairs of patient question and\nphysician answer.\nFull preprocessing details\nappear in Appendix A.2.\n3.2\nAutomated redirection annotation\nTo construct the primary MedRedFlag dataset, we\nimplement an automated pipeline for detecting redi-\nrection in human clinician responses relative to\npatient questions.\nWe construct a staged, automated pipeline to\nsummarize the original patient question, compare\nthis to the implicit question that the physician ac-\ntually appears to answer, and then extract the\nfalse assumptions and misconceptions that the\nphysician appears to be correcting in any redirected\nresponses.\nOur full pipeline (Fig. 2A) uses GPT-5 (gpt-5-\n2025-08-07) to automatically annotate 33,090 QA\ninstances in MedRedQA after our pre-processing\nstage:\n1. Summarize a single-sentence statement of the\noriginal patient question asked in the full pa-\ntient text (Fig. 2A, i).\n2. Summarize a single-sentence statement of the\nimplicit question answered in the clinician re-\nsponse from the full clinician response text (Fig.\n2A, ii). This stage can be construed as infer-\nring an implicit question under discussion that\nthe clinician chooses to answer, as in linguistic\ndiscourse theory (Roberts, 2012).\n3. Tag QA pairs for redirection if the summa-\nrized patient and clinician questions differ sig-\nnificantly (Fig. 2A, iii). We find that this staged\napproach improves annotation accuracy (rather\nthan directly tagging QA-pairs for redirection).\nOur pipeline additionally filters out QA pairs\nwith non-medical redirection, such as humor or\nother non-medical replies.\n4.

A physician author also manually reviewed\na random sample of 300 cases that were tagged for\nredirection. 7 of the 300 cases either did not dis-\nplay redirection or contained additional context\nthat should have been excluded in post-processing\n(false positive rate around 2%).\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "3.4\nWhen and how do human clinicians\nredirect?\nOur physician author qualitatively analyzed when\nand why human clinicians chose to redirect miscon-\nceptions in the patient questions. This physician-\ndriven taxonomy of medical redirection (found in\nfull in Appendix A.3) provides an expert basis for\nevaluating and improving current AI-based ques-\ntion answering. We summarize several core themes\nhere. Themes are not mutually exclusive, and redi-\nrection often occurs due to multiple concerns.\n• Urgency, safety, and prioritization: medical\nquestions can embed assumptions about life-\nthreatening consequences. Clinicians may redi-\nrect because the patient does not seem to realize\nthe medical urgency of the situation (e.g. in\nFig. 2B, bottom, the patient assumes they have\na benign condition when their symptoms should\nbe evaluated for cancer), or because the patient\nis asking for advice about a potentially danger-\nous procedure (e.g. Fig. 2B, top, the patient\nis looking for advice about a dangerous fasting\ntechnique).\n• Premise Reframing:\nquestions can embed\nfollow-ups based on incorrect or unanswerable\npremises, e.g. based on misinterpreting symp-\ntoms or observations (e.g. top of Fig.1) or as-\nsuming an incorrect diagnosis (e.g. bottom of\nFig.1). In these cases, clinicians have to clarify\nhow to correctly interpret the observed context,\nrather than answer based on incorrect premises.\n• Uncertainty: questions that ask for predictions\nthat cannot be provided due to aleatoric (e.g.,\ncertain prognoses) or epistemic uncertainty (e.g.,\ndue to patients providing insufficient informa-\ntion). In these cases, clinicians often follow up\nasking for more information, or explain that one\ncannot extrapolate from population statistics.\nRedirection is a strong conversational choice. Our\nphysician co-authors emphasized that clinicians\nredirect because it would be harmful or impossible\nfor the patient to proceed based on their original\nunderlying misconceptions. In such cases, answer-\ning the original question would often reinforce the\noriginal unsafe or invalid misconceptions.\n4\nCharacterizing LLM Response\n4.1\nModels\nWe evaluated two state-of-the-art proprietary lan-\nguage models GPT-5 (snapshot:\ngpt-5-2025-\n08-07) (OpenAI, 2025) and Claude Opus 4.5\n(snapshot: claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (Anthropic,\n2025), and two recent open-source models Llama-\n3.3-70B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024) and\nMedGemma-27b-it, which is Google’s medically\ninstruction-tuned adaptation of Gemma 3 (Seller-\ngren et al., 2025). For each model, we provided\nthe patient question as the user prompt with a con-\nsistent system prompt designed to elicit medical\nadvice (Appendix B). Temperature was set to 0 for\nall models that supported this parameter to ensure\ndeterministic generation.\n4.2\nMetrics\nFor effective redirection behavior, we expect a re-\nsponse to explicitly address false assumptions while\nrefraining from providing answers that implicitly\nvalidate or reinforce them. Therefore we evaluate\neach LLM response on two complementary dimen-\nsions using GPT-5 as a judge: (1) False Assump-\ntions Addressed (↑): whether the response explic-\nitly addresses or corrects false/unsafe assumptions\nembedded in patient questions, and (2) False As-\nsumptions Accommodated (↓): whether the re-\nsponse still answers the original patient question,\nthereby treating the false/unsafe assumptions as\nvalid or acceptable. Examples of both dimensions\ncan be found in Figure 3.\nFor False Assumptions Addressed, the judge\nconsiders the LLM response with respect to the\nfalse assumptions extracted in Step 4 of the dataset\npipeline. For each assumption, the LLM-as-a-judge\noutputs a binary decision based on whether the\nmodel response explicitly addresses or corrects the\nfalse assumption (1) or fails to do so (0). When an\nassumption is labeled as addressed, the judge ad-\nditionally extracts the specific sentence(s) or short\nspans from the response that provide evidence of\nthis correction.\nTo assess False Assumptions Accommodated,\nwe similarly apply an LLM-as-a-judge, but flip the\ncriterion to whether the response implicitly accepts\nor reinforces the embedded false assumptions. For\neach question in the test set, physician co-authors\nmanually defined the conditions under which a re-\nsponse would be considered accommodating of the\nfalse assumption; these were manually written, as\neach depends on the motivation behind redirection\n(as described in S3.4).\nFor example, consider the case from Figure 3:\nthe patient requires immediate in-person evaluation\nin the emergency department.

In\nthis case, the manually written physician condition\nwould be: “Does the response describe splinter re-\nmoval?” (more examples see Appendix B.4). The\nLLM-as-a-judge outputs a binary label for each\nquestion indicating the presence (1) or absence\n(0) of accommodation, and if applicable, the sen-\ntence(s) that provide supporting evidence.\nTo assess the reliability of the LLM-as-a-judge,\nwe compared its binary judgments on both metrics\nagainst annotations by two physician authors. 110\nlabels were annotated for False Assumptions Ad-\ndressed, and 55 labels were annotated for False\nAssumptions Accommodated. For both metrics,\nconcordance between the physicians and the LLM-\nas-a-judge were 93%. This indicates the validity of\nboth metrics and that the manually written condi-\ntions operated as intended.\n4.3\nQuantitative Results\nWe evaluate model behavior on 100 patient ques-\ntions from MedRedFlag, with results provided in\nTable 1. Since models may choose to focus on\nthe most important incorrect assumption, for False\nAssumptions Addressed, we report whether any\nof multiple false assumptions were addressed, to\navoid penalizing models that may have focused on\na single assumption; more fine-grained evaluation\ncan be found in Appendix Table 3.\nThe results show that frontier closed-source mod-\nels are relatively proficient at recognizing and ad-\ndressing patient assumptions, and open-sourced\nalternatives still catch at least half of false assump-\ntions. However, across the board, even when mod-\nels identify and correct unsafe assumptions, they\nstill provide guidance that implicitly accommo-\ndates those assumptions the vast majority of the\ntime. This trend can be seen reflected in the ex-\namples in Figure 3. These results suggest that cor-\nrecting a false assumption alone is insufficient to\nprevent harmful accommodation.\n4.4\nQualitative Results from Physician Review\nWhile LLMs often recognize false assumptions,\nphysicians found that the correction was frequently\n“drowned out” by the sheer volume of information\nthat still answers the underlying question.

The LLM is\nsupplied with an oracle list of false assumptions\nextracted from the gold-standard clinician re-\nsponse. It is prompted to respond to the original\nquestion with these assumptions in mind. This\nisolates the ability to redirect, assuming perfect\nability to identify false assumptions.\n• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Re-\ncent work has employed retrieval-augmented\napproaches to verify presuppositions and cor-\nrect false premises in question answering (Yu\net al., 2023; Srikanth et al., 2024). Following\nthese works, we augment the patient questions\nwith five most relevant text chunks retrieved by\nMedRAG (Xiong et al., 2024). Details can be\nfound in Appendix C.\n5.2\nResults\nWe apply the mitigation strategies to all four LLMs\nand compare the results against their baseline per-\nformance (Table 2). The Identify and Respond\napproach had no discernible effect on what percent-\nage of responses addressed the false assumptions,\nbut the safety awareness did decrease the rate of\naccommodating the false assumptions across the\nboard. The Oracle Assumptions Provided strat-\negy unsurprisingly achieved near perfect perfor-\nmance at addressing false assumptions and was\nalso the most effective at lowering accommoda-\ntion rates. However, even with perfect recall of\nfalse assumptions, models still yield to dangerous\nbehavior, indicating identification of patient mis-\nconceptions is insufficient for safer answers. The\nRAG approach generally worsened performance on\naddressing false assumptions compared to baseline,\nbut also reduced accommodation rates.\n6\nDiscussion\nOur evaluation of LLM redirection capabilities\nshows that models still accommodate false patient\nassumptions, even when they have oracle access to\nthese misconceptions. Even the best-performing\nconfiguration (Claude Opus 4.5 with oracle assump-\ntions) still accommodated 33% of questions with\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Model\nBaseline\nIdentify and Respond\nOracle Assumptions Provided\nRAG\nPercentage (%) False Assumptions Addressed (↑)\nGPT-5\n88\n85\n100\n75\nClaude Opus 4.5\n78\n84\n99\n69\nLlama-3.3-70B\n50\n43\n95\n43\nMedGemma-27b\n71\n71\n98\n36\nPercentage (%) False Assumptions Accommodated (↓)\nGPT-5\n73\n72\n60\n67\nClaude Opus 4.5\n60\n55\n33\n49\nLlama-3.3-70B\n74\n52\n39\n52\nMedGemma-27b\n74\n67\n40\n43\nTable 2: Percentage of the MedRedFlag test set where models explicitly addressed the false assumption or accom-\nmodated the false assumptions, under different mitigation strategies.\nharmful misconceptions. This reveals two sepa-\nrable challenges of conducting redirection. First,\nmodels must identify and verify problematic as-\nsumptions, a capability that is relatively strong in\ncurrent frontier models. Second, when models rec-\nognize false or dangerous premises, they must be\nable to refrain from answering the patient’s explicit\nbuilt on these assumptions, which is an (in)ability\nthat has been less explored and suggests room for\nimprovement to alignment objectives.\nAligned models typically interpret helpfulness\nas “answering the question asked,” and their re-\nward is often determined by the user who asked the\nquestion. However, in MedRedFlag, there can be a\nnontrivial divergence between what patients want\nto hear and what they need to hear. True physician\nredirection explicitly does not answer the patient’s\ndirect question. Current alignment techniques may\ninadvertently train models to avoid the “friction” of\ncorrection, thereby reinforcing confirmation bias in\npatients who may already be resistant to standard\nmedical advice. This not only risks entrenching\na specific, incorrect narrative but also potentially\nerodes the physician-patient relationship; when a\nhuman physician appropriately redirects the work-\nup toward a more probable cause, the patient may\nperceive this as a dismissal rather than a necessary\ncorrection of AI advice. Prioritizing medical safety\nover question-answering completeness may require\noverriding this “helpfulness” prior.\nFuture Work\nOur findings suggest several directions for future\nwork. Most notably, there is room for improvement\nin both improving how often false assumptions\nare addressed (especially for open-source models)\nand particularly how often false assumptions are\naccommodated. In particular, identification of false\nassumptions are insufficient to promote redirective\nbehavior, and new alignment objectives may be\nrequired. Our results also build on recent work\nthat point to the fact that models need to more\nproactively seek clarification when encountering\nunclear or potentially dangerous premises, rather\nthan attempting immediate answers. This context-\nseeking behavior represents an interaction design\nchoice that may prove critical for safe clinical AI.\nAdditionally, studying how users respond to redi-\nrection from clinicians and LLMs that question\ntheir assumptions would provide crucial insights\ninto real-world effectiveness of these interventions\nand medical dialogue dynamics. Finally, further\nprobing MedRedQA and other datasets to build a\nhuman baseline for redirection behavior would help\ncontextualize LLM performance.\n7\nConclusion\nOur work presents MedRedFlag, a dataset of 1100+\nreal-world pairs of patient questions and redirected\nclinician responses. Our LLM performance bench-\nmark demonstrates LLMs’ limited capabilities at\nredirecting responses away from false or unsafe\nassumptions, which persist despite the initial mit-\nigations we explored. Our dataset, analyses, and\nfindings expand the landscape for exploring how\nmodels can prioritize medical safety over immedi-\nate and direct question answering.\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Limitations\nBecause the questions and responses in our source\ndataset MedRedQA are publicly available cases\nfrom the online forum Reddit, they may already be\nin the training data for the models we evaluate. This\nraises the possibility that strong performance could\nreflect memorization rather than generalizable rea-\nsoning. Therefore, while performing well on this\ndataset is necessary for safe clinical deployment, it\nis insufficient to demonstrate that models can reli-\nably handle novel cases with problematic premises.\nWe also note some limitations that stem from the\npreprocessing of the original MedRedQA dataset.\nSince we cannot rescrape the original Reddit posts,\nit can be difficult to perfectly flag certain cases with\nundesired characteristics, e.g., image attachments\n(more details see Appendix A.2). This may intro-\nduce noise or ambiguous cases to MedRedFlag that\naffect the consistency and interpretability of our\nevaluation results.\nEthical Considerations\nWe derive and evaluations from a publicly avail-\nable dataset MedRedQA, that had been collated\nbefore Reddit’s API changes. However, given the\nsensitivity of the information in the dataset and\nthe terms of MedRedQA, our research plan was re-\nviewed by our institution’s IRB and deemed to be\nexempt. Release of our dataset will be governed by\nthe same or tighter regulations than that on the orig-\ninal dataset to preserve data privacy. All examples\nin the manuscript are purposefully hand-written to\nloosely resemble the style of real patient cases with-\nout explicitly sharing them, as the original users\nwho posted questions likely did not intend for their\nposts to be disseminated in a paper.\nAdditionally, we recognize ethical tensions in\nour framework. While MedRedFlag presumes that\npatient questions embed false assumptions based\non physician judgment, we acknowledge that doubt-\ning patient-reported information can risk undermin-\ning patient autonomy, trust, and legitimacy of lived\nexperience. We recognize that physicians are fal-\nlible, and the original responses may have been\nimperfect. Unfortunately, there exists an inher-\nent statistical tradeoff in balancing false positive\ncases, where answers inappropriately redirect pa-\ntient questions with valid assumptions, and false\nnegative cases, where answers provide potentially\nunsafe information. We believe that future work\nrequires the voices of both physicians and patients.\nReferences\nAnnenberg Public Policy Center. 2025.

During the\noriginal dataset construction, URLs and image-\ncontaining posts were removed (Nguyen et al.,\n2023). However, we applied additional systematic\nfiltering to ensure more comprehensive removal of\ninaccessible content and to ensure that LLMs and\nphysicians operate under comparable conditions\nwhile protecting patient privacy.\nStarting from an initial corpus of 50,991 pa-\ntient–physician interactions, we applied a conser-\nvative regex-based prefiltering procedure with man-\nual verification to remove entries containing image\nreferences, edit or update markers such as “edit:”\nor “Update:”, privacy-sensitive information, or too-\nshort textual content. This step removed 17,901\ninteractions in total, including 10,771 with image\nreferences, 3,806 with edit or update markers, 253\nwith privacy-related content, and 6,283 with in-\nsufficient textual length, yielding 33,090 usable\ninteractions. Regular expressions were applied to\nboth patient questions and physician responses.\nRegex filters\nIMAGE_PATTERN = re.compile(\nr\"\"\"(\nattach (?:ed|ment|ing)?\n|\nphoto (?:s|graph|\ngraphic)? |\npictur (?:e|es|ed|ing)?\n|\nscreenshot (?:s)? |\n\\bpic (?:s)?\\b |\nimage (?:s)? |\nimg(?:ur)? |\njpeg | jpg | png |\ngif | bmp | tiff |\nwebp | svg |\nupload (?:ed|ing)? |\n\\blink (?:ed)?\\b |\n\\bview (?:\\s?this)?\\b |\n\\bsee\\s?(below|\nabove|\nattached)\\b\n)\"\"\",\nre.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE\n)\nEDIT_PATTERN = re.compile(\nr\"\"\"\n\\bedit (?:\\s*\\d+)?\\s*[:.*-]\n\"\"\",\nre.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE\n)\nUPDATE_PATTERN =\nre.compile(r\"\\ bupdate\\b\",\nre.IGNORECASE)\n"}, {"page": 18, "text": "PRIVACY_PATTERN = re.compile(\nr\"\"\"(\n\\bhipaa\\b |\n\\bphi\\b |\nprotected\\s+health\\s\n+information |\npatient\\s+privacy |\nmedical\\s+privacy |\nprivacy\\s+concern (?:s)?\n|\nprivacy\\s+issue (?:s)?\n|\nconfidentiality |\nconfidential (?: ity)? |\n\\bconsent\\b |\n\\bde[-\\s]? identified\\b\n|\n\\banonym (?: ous|\nized|\nity)\\b |\n\\bprivate\\s+(?: info|\ninformation|\ndetails)\\b |\n\\bwithout\\s+(?:my|\ntheir)\\s\n+permission\\b\n|\n\\bkept\\s+private\\b |\n\\blegal\\s+obligation\\b\n)\"\"\",\nre.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE\n)\nWe next applied the redirection extraction\npipeline to the regex-filtered dataset, yielding 1,415\ncandidate redirection cases. Following redirection\nextraction, we performed targeted post-processing\nand quality control. We first removed 217 interac-\ntions with missing or incomplete context, in which\nthe physician response appeared to rely on infor-\nmation not present in the patient’s original textual\nquestion. These cases likely reflected engagement\nwith unavailable context, including follow-up com-\nments within the thread, implicit assumptions de-\nrived from the broader discussion context, or con-\ntent from URLs that had been removed during pre-\nprocessing but originally contained essential infor-\nmation such as images of test results or medical\nrecords. To systematically identify such cases, we\nemployed an LLM-based classifier that evaluates\nwhether a clinician response references unstated\ninformation, such as replying as if to a prior mes-\nsage, correcting an unexpressed belief, or advising\nagainst an action never mentioned by the patient.\nSimilarly, We additionally flagged cases con-\ntaining the token “[” as an indicator of embedded\nhyperlinks or formatting artifacts. Manual inspec-\ntion of these flagged interactions revealed that they\noften contained links to external content providing\nessential contextual information, such as images of\nmedical tests or medical records. Because this ex-\nternal information was not available in the dataset,\nthese cases were excluded during post-extraction\nquality control. In addition, we removed physician\nresponses containing phrases such as “look like” or\n“looks like”, which frequently indicated implicit ref-\nerences to image attachments, as well as responses\nthat were found to address follow-up comments\nrather than the original patient question. These mis-\ncellaneous filtering with manual efforts accounted\nfor 95 removals. The final dataset comprised 1,103\nhigh-quality redirection examples.\nSince the original URLs were already removed\nfrom MedRedQA, we cannot verify all cases with\nlinks. While our filtering captures identifiable pat-\nterns, some questions or answers may still ref-\nerence inaccessible content through less obvious\nphrasing. For filtering steps requiring manual veri-\nfication, some posts could not be retrieved for re-\nview; we chose to retain these cases in the dataset,\nwhich may have affected the completeness of our\nfiltering validation. Additionally, even with edit\nmarker filtering, temporal information may remain\nunclear. We acknowledge these as inherent limita-\ntions when working with retrospectively processed\nforum data.\nA.3\nRedirection Taxonomy\nEmergent Safety/Immediate Escalation\nThe\nphysician identifies a potentially urgent or life-\nthreatening condition and redirects toward imme-\ndiate evaluation (e.g., ED/911/urgent care). The\npatient’s original question may be deferred because\nsafety takes priority.\nSetting Mismatch\nEven if it does not require an\nemergent or immediate escalation, the question can-\nnot be safely/accurately answered without physical\nexam, imaging, or labs. The physician redirects\nto the appropriate setting or next diagnostic step\nwithout answering the question.\n"}, {"page": 19, "text": "Clinical Prioritization\nThe physician redirects\nto address a different clinical issue that is more\nrelevant to the patient, even if it is not strictly emer-\ngent (e.g., uncontrolled comorbidity, medication\nrisk, missing preventive care). The original ques-\ntion may be answered later or indirectly answered\nthrough this redirection.\nPremise Correction / Reframing\nThe patient’s\nquestion rests on an incorrect premise (e.g., as-\nsumed diagnosis, misinterpreted findings, or an\ninappropriate “next step” based on that assump-\ntion). Rather than answering the question as stated,\nthe physician redirects to correct the premise and\nreframe the scenario into a clinically coherent prob-\nlem.\nInappropriate or Non-Indicated Request\nThe\npatient requests an intervention or plan that is not\nclinically appropriate given the available informa-\ntion (e.g., unnecessary procedure, inappropriate\nantibiotic, unsafe medication choice). The physi-\ncian redirects either toward guideline-concordant\nalternatives or to challenging the premise of the\nintervention.\nUnsafe Plan or Harm Reduction\nThe patient is\ndoing (or plans to do) something potentially harm-\nful (dangerous self-management, contraindicated\nmeds, unproven treatments). Redirection focuses\non stopping harm and offering safer substitutes.\nInherent Unanswerability / Prognostic Uncer-\ntainty\nThe question cannot be answered mean-\ningfully due to irreducible uncertainty, complexity,\nor predictive limits (e.g., exact prognosis, individu-\nalized risk without data). Redirection sets expecta-\ntions or asks related questions to assist the patient.\nNon-Clinical / Administrative / Legal\nThe ques-\ntion is primarily legal, employment, insurance, doc-\numentation, privacy, or institutional policy rather\nthan clinical care. Redirection routes the patient to\nappropriate resources.\nB\nLLM Response Generation and\nEvaluation\nB.1\nLLMs\nWe evaluated four state-of-art LLMs: GPT-5 (snap-\nshot: gpt-5-2025-08-07), Claude Opus 4.5 (snap-\nshot: claude-opus-4-5-20251101), Llama-3.3-70B-\nInstruct, and MedGemma-27b-it.\nGPT-5 and\nClaude Opus 4.5 were accessed via OpenAI and\nAnthropic APIs respectively; temperature was set\nto 0 for Claude Opus 4.5. We ran Llama 3.3 70B\nand MedGemma 27B using vLLM (Kwon et al.,\n2023), setting a maximum context length of 8,192\ntokens and temperature of 0, consuming approxi-\nmately 90 GPU-hours total on A100 and RTX Pro\n6000 GPUs.\nB.2\nBaseline LLM Response Generation\nThe baseline LLM responses are obtained with the\nfollowing system prompt and the patient question\nas the whole user input.\nPrompt: LLM response generation (system)\nYou are a helpful medical\nassistant.

Affirmative\nanswers indicate accommodation: by providing\nthe requested information, the response implicitly\ntreats the false assumptions in the question as valid\nand risks reinforcing them.\nTo generate false-assumption support conditions,\nclinicians reviewed each patient question and spec-\nified what would constitute an inappropriate re-\nsponse. While physician responses were available\nfor the reviewed questions, the false-assumption\nsupport condition was defined independently of\nthose responses. More examples see Table 4.\nWe used GPT-5 (snapshot: gpt-5-2025-08-07)\nas judge for determine if an LLM response pro-\nvides an affirmative answer to each criterion ques-\ntion.
