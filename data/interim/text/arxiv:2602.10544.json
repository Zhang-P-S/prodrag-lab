Severe shortage\nof epileptologists creates care gaps, particularly in low- and middle-\nincome countries with 80% of patients [1]. Automated EEG analysis\nwill transform care access through scalable monitoring and diagnos-\ntic reporting. However, a fundamental barrier blocks deployment:\nloss of diagnostic precision under extreme compression required\nfor LLM-based report generation.\nClinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring\ncompression ratios exceeding 400:1. This destroys fine-grained tem-\nporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes 3 Hz absence epilepsy\nfrom 3.5 Hz Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, altering treatment decisions.\nLLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statisti-\ncal associations from compressed representations. This compression-\nprecision paradox is a mathematical necessity imposed by context\nwindow constraints.\nExisting approaches are inadequate. EEG-GPT [2], BENDR [3], and\nbiosignal-to-text systems [4] compress signals into neural represen-\ntations before text generation, destroying clinical measurement\nprecision and producing hallucinated values. With human inter-\nrater reliability at 𝜅=0.29-0.73 [5] and FDA demanding traceable\nmeasurements, clinical deployment requires guaranteed accuracy.\narXiv:2602.10544v1  [cs.LG]  11 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "ICPHDS 2025, November 21–23, 2025, Yantai, China\nZhang et al.\nOur key insight separates measurement extraction from text\ngeneration.

(iv) We demonstrate clini-\ncal deployability with FDA-compliant traceability and sub-minute\nlatency.\n2\nRelated Work\nExisting approaches fail to address dual limitations: (1) extreme\ncompression destroying measurement precision, and (2) language\nmodels lacking time-series comprehension.\n2.1\nEEG and Time-Series Foundation Models\nRecent foundation models (EEG-GPT [2], BENDR [3], EEGFormer [6])\ncompress multi-channel data into compact representations, de-\nstroying fine-grained measurements needed to distinguish diag-\nnostic boundaries. Time-series models (Chronos-2 [7], PatchTST [8],\nTimesFM [9]) demonstrate strong forecasting but do not guarantee\nmeasurement precision. A 0.5 Hz error is statistically minor but\nclinically catastrophic. We adopt architectural principles (patching,\ngroup attention) but introduce measurement-first signal processing\nand graph-aware layers.\n2.2\nMedical Report Generation\nVision-language models generate radiology reports from static im-\nages [10–12], but successes do not transfer to dynamic multi-channel\nEEG. Fitting hours of high-frequency data into LLM context win-\ndows requires 400:1+ compression, destroying measurement preci-\nsion [13]. FDA guidance requires traceable outputs [14]. With human\ninter-rater reliability at 𝜅= 0.3–0.7 [5], automated systems must\nguarantee measurement accuracy.\n3\nProblem Formulation\n3.1\nTask Definition\nGiven multi-channel EEG X ∈R𝐶×𝑇, we generate report R =\n(T, V) where T is narrative text and V = {(𝑣𝑖,𝑐𝑖,𝑠𝑖)}𝑚\n𝑖=1 contains\nprecise measurements with provenance. Diagnostic boundaries re-\nquire 𝜖𝑓= 0.1 Hz (frequency), 𝜖𝑑= 0.5 s (duration), 𝜖𝑎= 5 𝜇V (am-\nplitude). We use hierarchical sampling: low-rate X(𝐿) (256–512 Hz)\nfor context, high-rate X(𝐻) (≥1 kHz) for events, with channel graph\n𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸) for spatial inference.\nFigure 1: Hybrid architecture: hierarchical sampling balances\ncontext and precision; signal processing extracts measure-\nments before compression; cross-modal bridge translates\nto language space; constrained decoder generates reports\naround frozen slots.\n3.2\nThe Compression-Precision Paradox\nCompressing |X| = 322, 560 to 𝑑∈{512, 1024} yields 𝜌> 300 com-\npression, bounded by 𝐼(X; z) ≤log2(|Z|). Frequency resolution\nΔ𝑓min ≈0.74 Hz exceeds clinical 𝜖𝑓= 0.1 Hz by 7×, and temporal\nquantization Δ𝑡min ≈2.1 s exceeds 𝜖𝑑= 0.5 s.\n3.3\nFundamental Limitations of End-to-End\nLearning\nWhen compression destroys precise values, LLMs generate training\ndistribution modes, causing systematic hallucination.\nTheorem 1. For any encoder 𝑓𝜃: R𝐶×𝑇→R𝑑with 𝜌> 100, distinct\nsignals X1, X2 with |𝑣1−𝑣2| > 𝜖clinical satisfy ||𝑓𝜃(X1)−𝑓𝜃(X2)||2 < 𝛿\nfor arbitrarily small 𝛿.\nProof. By pigeonhole principle, 2𝐶×𝑇×𝑏inputs map to ≈2𝑑×𝑏′ em-\nbeddings, so clinically distinct signals become indistinguishable.\n□\n4\nMethodology\n4.1\nSolution Overview\nOur hybrid architecture (Figure 1) separates measurement extrac-\ntion from text generation to resolve the compression-precision\nparadox. The key insight: compute exact clinical values via signal\nprocessing before neural compression, then use language models\nsolely for narrative composition around frozen measurement slots.\nPipeline. (1) Hierarchical multirate sampling maintains syn-\nchronized low-rate (256–512Hz) and high-rate (≥1kHz) streams.\nLow-rate provides hours of context; high-rate windows (Eq. (2))\ncapture event-level precision only where needed, avoiding compu-\ntational explosion. (2) Measurement-first guardrails compute\nexact values (frequency via Welch PSD Eq. (7), duration, amplitude,\nlocalization) with full provenance before any neural processing.\nThese frozen slots are immutable. (3) Graph-aware modeling pro-\ncesses dual-view inputs (time-domain patches, transform-domain\nbandpower) using group attention augmented with channel-graph\nstructure (Eq. (3)) and linear-time SSM layers for ultra-long se-\nquences. (4) Output heads include quantile forecasting (pinball\nloss Eq. (4)), seizure detection, and EMD-aware value prediction\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Bridging the Compression-Precision Paradox: A Hybrid Architecture for\nClinical EEG Report Generation with Guaranteed Measurement Accuracy\nICPHDS 2025, November 21–23, 2025, Yantai, China\nTable 1: Key hyperparameters (defaults; vary by dataset/ab-\nlation).\nComponent\nSetting\nSampling\nLow: 256–512Hz; High: ≥1kHz\nEvent windows\n𝑊= 2–10s; margins ±2s\nWelch PSD\n8 segments; 50% overlap\nPatches\nCoarse 64; fine 256\nBackbone\n𝑑= 512; 8 heads; 4 layers\nForecasting\n9 quantiles; horizon 64\nCalibration\n𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑙= 256; 𝛼= 0.9\n(Eq.

Table 1 summarizes key settings (tuned on\nvalidation data).\n4.2\nFeature Extraction and Neural Architecture\nHierarchical multirate sampling. We maintain synchronized low-\nrate (256–512Hz) and high-rate (≥1kHz) streams after standard\npreprocessing (notch 50/60Hz, bandpass 0.5–80Hz). The low-rate\nstream continuously captures hours of context. High-rate windows\nwith temporal margins (±2s) are extracted around candidate events\ndetected via energy, kurtosis, and spectral peaks with spatial con-\nsensus [15]. This avoids processing hours at high sampling rates\nwhile preserving event-level precision.\nMeasurement-first guardrails. Before neural processing, we com-\npute exact values via Welch PSD (Eq. (7)) for dominant frequency\narg max𝜔ˆ𝑆𝑥𝑥(𝜔), hysteresis thresholding for durations, median\nabsolute deviation for amplitudes, and graph-based asymmetry in-\ndices for lateralization. These frozen slots carry full provenance\nand serve as immutable supervision targets.\nNeural architecture. Models process dual-view inputs (time-domain\npatches and transform-domain bandpower), plus channel graph\nstructure and covariates. Group attention [7] shares information\nwithin channel sets, augmented with graph attention (Eq. (3)) for\nspatial coherence. SSM layers (S4/Mamba [16,17]) provide linear-time\nlong-range modeling, interleaved with attention for local detail.\nOutput heads include quantile forecasting (pinball loss Eq. (4)),\nseizure detection, and EMD-aware value prediction (Eq. (5)).\n4.3\nCross-Modal Bridge\nThe cross-modal bridge translates EEG features into language-\ncompatible semantic space while preserving measurement fidelity.\nEEG encoder outputs zEEG ∈R768 must interface with LLM se-\nmantic spaces (𝑑𝐿≈4096). Rather than direct projection, we use\nprogressive expansion 𝑓bridge : R768 →R4096 with intermediate lay-\ners (768→1536→2816→4096) to prevent information bottlenecks.\nLearnable semantic anchors {a𝑘}𝐾\n𝑘=1 guide the mapping from\nelectrophysiological patterns to clinical concepts (seizure status,\ntemporal characteristics, type, severity, spatial patterns). Initialized\nfrom medical terminology embeddings, these anchors are refined\nvia contrastive alignment [18,19] using temperature-scaled InfoNCE\nloss, encouraging EEG embeddings to align with semantically simi-\nlar clinical descriptions.\nThe complete representation concatenates bridge output, frozen\nmeasurements, and context:\nhcomplete = [hbridge; mfrozen; ccontext]\n(1)\nwhere mfrozen contains exact values (frequency, duration, amplitude,\nlocation) from signal processing. Special formatting signals the\ndecoder to copy these values verbatim, ensuring measurement\nfidelity while leveraging neural models for narrative fluency.\n4.4\nValue Extraction and Calibration\nDSP routines compute exact clinical values and insert them as im-\nmutable slots with full provenance (method, window, parameters).\nThe text generator is constrained to copy these values, not generate\nthem. Low-confidence events trigger rule-based fallback phrasing.\nFor neural value prediction, discretized outputs (frequency/du-\nration bins) use EMD-aware supervision (Eq. (5)) that penalizes\ncumulative distribution discrepancies [20,21], reducing regression-by-\nclassification artifacts. Conformalized quantile regression (Eq. (6))\nguarantees coverage for probabilistic forecasts under distribution\nshift [22]. Change-point tests trigger adaptive recalibration during\nnonstationarity. Post-hoc constraints enforce physiologic plausibil-\nity (nonnegative amplitudes, band-consistent frequencies); viola-\ntions trigger re-measurement or abstention.\n4.5\nReport Generation\nWe employ parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation [23] (𝑟= 16, 𝛼= 32)\nto specialize a pretrained LLM for clinical reporting. Generation\nproceeds in two stages: (i) emit structured JSON schema with frozen\nmeasurement slots; (ii) condition on schema to generate narrative.\nConstrained beam search with custom masking restricts numeric\ngeneration to copying from frozen slots, preventing hallucination.\nEvery value carries full provenance (algorithm, window, channels)\nfor traceability and compliance.\n4.6\nMathematical Formulation\nHierarchical sampling. Low-rate stream X(𝐿) ∈R𝐶×𝑇𝐿and high-\nrate stream X(𝐻) ∈R𝐶×𝑇𝐻are synchronized. Gating function G\nselects event windows W = {[𝑡(𝑚)\n𝑠\n,𝑡(𝑚)\n𝑒\n]}𝑚from X(𝐿) via ener-\ngy/kurtosis/spectral peaks.

We assess three core tasks: (i) seizure detection\n(false alarms/24h, latency), (ii) value extraction (frequency, dura-\ntion, amplitude MAE), and (iii) localization (lateralization accuracy,\nspatial overlap). Results are stratified by sampling rate (low ≤256Hz,\nmid 384–512Hz, high ≥1kHz) to assess precision-rate tradeoffs.\n5.2\nBaselines and Protocol\nWe compare against classical detectors (energy/rhythm threshold-\ning), deep EEG models (EEGNet [27], DeepConvNet [28], BENDR [3],\nEEGFormer [6]), and Chronos-2-style forecasting [7]. Ablations re-\nmove individual components: graph attention, SSM layers, hierar-\nchical sampling, measurement guardrails, and conformal calibra-\ntion.\nWe use patient-wise cross-validation with early stopping. Class\nimbalance is handled via focal loss for detection and EMD-aware\nsupervision for discretized values. Online conformal calibration\nensures coverage guarantees. All experiments use fixed seeds (42),\nPyTorch 2.3, and run on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.1\n6\nResults\nResults use patient-wise paired tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank) with\nper-corpus stratification.\n1Full reproducibility details, hyperparameters, and code will be released upon\npublication.\n6.1\nDetection, Localization, and Value\nExtraction\nTable 2(b) and Figure 5 show our method achieves 0.51 FA/24h on\nTUH (vs. 1.16 for EEGNet) with 10.5s latency (vs. 24.2s). Hierarchi-\ncal sampling enables early detection without inflating false alarms,\nwhile SSM layers handle extended contexts. For value extraction (Ta-\nble 2(c), Figure 4(a)), measurement-first guardrails achieve 0.18 Hz\nfrequency MAE—within clinical tolerance (0.1 Hz) and 62% better\nthan EEGNet. EMD-aware supervision reduces errors near critical\nboundaries (3.0 vs. 3.5 Hz). Graph-aware modeling improves later-\nalization to 85%+ accuracy and Jaccard overlap >0.7 (Figure 4(b)),\nparticularly for multi-focal patterns.\n6.2\nAblations and Efficiency\nFigure 2(a) quantifies component contributions. Removing guardrails\ndegrades value MAE by 44%, removing graph attention reduces\nlocalization by 24%, removing SSM increases latency by 22%, re-\nmoving hierarchical sampling cuts precision by 23%, and remov-\ning calibration causes 31% undercoverage. Our hierarchical design\nachieves sub-minute end-to-end latency with manageable memory\n(Figure 2(b)), enabling clinical deployment. Orthonormal coefficient\ncomputation preserves bandpower within 2% error while reducing\nstorage 10× (Figure 2(c)).\n6.3\nRobustness and Sampling Rate Analysis\nUnder artifact injection (EOG/EMG/line noise) and missing chan-\nnels, FA/24h increases <30% and value errors <25% (Figure 3(a)).\nMeasurement guardrails prevent implausible outputs in contami-\nnated segments. Performance scales with sampling rate (Figure 3(b)):\nhigh-rate data (≥1kHz) improves detection latency and value pre-\ncision substantially, while low-rate (≤256Hz) suffices for routine\nmonitoring.\n7\nDiscussion\nOur hybrid architecture addresses critical gaps in automated EEG\nanalysis by separating measurement extraction from text genera-\ntion. The combination of signal processing guardrails, hierarchical\nsampling, and graph-aware modeling enables both clinical mea-\nsurement accuracy and scalable long-context processing.\nLimitations and future work. Several limitations warrant consid-\neration. First, our dual-stream architecture targets clinical worksta-\ntions; edge deployment on bedside monitors or wearables requires\noptimization through model pruning and quantization to meet\nmemory and power constraints. Second, frozen measurement slots\nprioritize numeric fidelity over natural language flexibility, limiting\nnuanced uncertainty phrasing and institution-specific terminol-\nogy—future work could explore adaptive template selection while\npreserving accuracy guarantees. Third, evaluation datasets (TUH,\nCHB-MIT) are US-based with limited demographic diversity and\nunderrepresent certain seizure subtypes (myoclonic, focal with pre-\nserved awareness, absence in adults); international multi-center val-\nidation across diverse populations is needed. Additional challenges\ninclude fully automating artifact handling and montage changes.\nPromising directions include subject-specific graph construction,\nadaptive calibration for rapid regime shifts, and semi-supervised\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Bridging the Compression-Precision Paradox: A Hybrid Architecture for\nClinical EEG Report Generation with Guaranteed Measurement Accuracy\nICPHDS 2025, November 21–23, 2025, Yantai, China\nCoverage_err\nFA/24h\nFreq_MAE\nLatency_s\nmetric\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nRelative change (%) (higher is worse)\nAblation\n-SSM\n-calibration\n-graph\n-guardrails\n-hierarchical\n(a) Ablation impacts\nOurs\nEEGNet\nDeepConvNet\nBENDR\nChronos2-baseline\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nLatency (ms)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nMemory (GB)\n(b) Latency and memory\nraw\ndwt-keep\ndct-keep\nmultirate-base\nmultirate+events\nsketch\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\nRelative error\nBandpower rel. error\nPSD rel. error\n(c) Compression sensitivity\nFigure 2: Ablations, efficiency, and compression analysis.

Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets demon-\nstrates substantial reductions in false alarms and detection latency\nwhile achieving measurement precision within clinical tolerance.\nThis measurement-first paradigm generalizes to high-frequency\nbiosignal domains requiring precise quantitative values alongside\ndescriptive text, enabling trustworthy clinical decision support with\nfull traceability.\nReferences\n[1] World Health Organization.
