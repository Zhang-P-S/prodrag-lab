Processing such\ndata requires both professional expertise and adapt-\nability to diverse reader needs. Recent reviews\nhighlight the heavy medical burden of such tasks\nin hospitals (Arndt et al., 2017; Sinsky et al.,\n2016; Tai-Seale et al., 2017). As a result, Clin-\nical Text Improvement, which enhances the pre-\ncision, clarity, and compliance of medical notes,\nhas become essential for improving healthcare effi-\nciency (Perkins et al., 2024; Bergomi et al., 2024).\nWhile Large Language Models (LLMs) show\npromise for medical assistance (Sandmann et al.,\n*Corresponding author.\n2025; Moor et al., 2023), reliable text improve-\nment remains challenging due to data scarcity and\nheterogeneous expectations. Unlike general writ-\ning, clinical documentation is shaped by implicit,\ncontext-specific constraints often defined by lim-\nited examples (Beldi et al., 2022).\nExisting\napproaches\nrely\non\nSupervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) (Ouyang et al., 2022) or\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis\net al., 2020), but both struggle with sparse and\nnoisy feedback. SFT is computationally expensive\nand ill-suited to small samples, while standard\nretrieval often fails to capture the reasoning behind\nrevisions.\nTo address these limitations, we advocate for a\nparadigm shift from data retrieval to experience\ncuration, optimization and retrieval. In this study,\nwe propose ExperienceWeaver, a hierarchical ex-\nperience distillation framework designed to learn\nand optimize experience from multi-dimensional,\nunprocessed feedback. We design a two layer dis-\ntillation process, and eventually formulate concrete,\nerror-specific Tips and high-level functional Strate-\ngies. To validate the performance, we conducted\nlarge scale simulated experiments and real-world\nvalidation.

Improving clinical text with evolving agents relies heavily on the efficiency of\nin-context learning. Current RAG-based methods often fail to provide sufficiently dense information and introduce\nredundancy in memory storage. The proposed method addresses these limitations by weaving experience from\nstored feedback, enabling more effective reasoning within memory.\nRAG, improving text quality with small-sample\nmulti-dimensional feedback.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLM-empowered Medical Text Editing\nSince the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs), their application in enhancing text quality\nhas been extensively investigated. Research has\nfrequently benchmarked LLM performance across\na range of medical text processing tasks, including\nstructured reporting (Bergomi et al., 2024; Sacoran-\nsky et al., 2024), translation (Guerreiro et al., 2024),\nand information extraction (Le Guellec et al., 2024;\nTang et al., 2024). However, incorporating feed-\nback is essential to align outputs with clinicians’\nexpectations. This presents a challenge, as human\nfeedback is often limited in quantity and irregular\nin form. Consequently, there is a need for methods\ncapable of analyzing and extracting hidden infor-\nmation from sparse, unstructured labels to better\nsupport clinical text improvement.\n2.2\nSelf-evolving Agent\nRecent research has increasingly focused on en-\nhancing LLM performance through the develop-\nment of self-evolving agent systems. These ap-\nproaches can be broadly categorized into three di-\nrections: policy training (Beldi et al., 2022), tool\ncreation and utilization (Yao et al., 2023; Qin et al.,\n2023; Schick et al., 2023), and experience-driven\nin-context learning (Wang et al., 2024b; Zhao et al.,\n2024; Qu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Zheng\net al., 2025). Policy training typically involves\npost-training an LLM with a reward model to cap-\nture user preferences and guide generation toward\ndesired outputs. Tool creation and utilization ex-\ntend LLM capabilities by integrating or developing\nexternal resources, such as web search, code gener-\nation, and mathematical computation.\nExperience-driven in-context learning plays a\nparticularly important role in small-sample sce-\nnarios. It emphasizes the accumulation of expe-\nrience, supported by critique and summarization\nmechanisms (Qu et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024;\nZheng et al., 2025), as well as effective memory\ncontrol (Wang et al., 2024b). These processes en-\nable precise knowledge extraction that enhances\ninference. Notably, this direction is especially well-\nsuited to text improvement tasks, as it facilitates\nefficient adaptation to limited, fine-grained user\nfeedback. Building on this foundation, this study\ninvestigates the construction of an effective experi-\nence system for clinical text improvement.\n3\nMethodology\nThis section presents the methodology of the pro-\nposed ExperienceWeaver and the agentic frame-\nwork for text improvement. The overall pipeline is\nillustrated in Figure 2.\n3.1\nExperience Weaver\nEffective in-context learning requires precise and\ninformative cues within a limited context window.\nTo address this, we propose ExperienceWeaver,\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Metric\nScore\nReasoning\nCorrectness\n4/5\nIt correctly detects…\nUsefulness\n3/5\nThe change is meaningful…\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\nRaw Text\nImproved Text\nUnit in Memory\nRecord 1\nRaw Text \nImproved Text\nFeedbacks\nRecord N\nRaw Text \nImproved Text\nFeedbacks\nMemory Storage\nExperience Pool\nStrategies Pool\nTips Pool\nStage 1: Weaving for Experience\nStage 2: Weaving for Retrieval\n(a) Experience Abstraction\n(b) Combination\nAbstract experiences to \nmeet the evaluation \nexpectation\nRecord 1 \nRecord 2 \nRecord 3 \nRecord N \nRecord N-1 \nRecord N+1 \nLLM\nLLM\nAbstraction Group \nLLM\nLLM\nLLM\nExperience Abstraction\nHierarchical Combination\nMetric 1 Weaving\nMetric 2\nIn stage 1, weave for each metric, and formulate an experience pool\nMetric 1\nMetric 2\nMetric 3 …\nLLM\nExperience\nComposite \nExperience\nDistilled Experience\nRetriever\nHere are revision strategies:\n {STRATEGIES}\nHere are detailed tips:\n{TIPS with SAMPLES}\nError Detection\nText Revision\nSelf-Critic\nStrategies, …\nStrategies, …\nStrategies, …\nError \nType 1\nError \nType N\nWeaving based \non Error Type\nLLM\nWeaving based \non Functions\n(c) Layered Experience Weaving\nRevision\nDetection\nSelf-Critic\nEvaluation\nStorage\nInput\nOverview:\nOutput\nExperience\nAgents\nScores, reasonings\nMetric 1\nMetric 2\nMetric 3\n⋮\nContain scores \nand reasoning \nfor each metric\nFigure 2: The pipeline of proposed ExperienceWeaver. The pipeline consists of two stages of weaving: first, a\nhierarchical auto-combination and distillation for experience abstracted from feedback; second, a re-weaving step to\nformulate error-specific tips and functional strategy layers. The goal is to inject distilled multi-layered experience\ninto the three phases in the agentic pipeline: error detection, text revision, and self-critique.\nwhich distills actionable experience prior to re-\ntrieval. The design optimizes two stages: (1) dis-\ntillation, where feedback is compressed into a con-\ndensed form, and (2) retrieval, where abstracted\nexperience is re-structured for practical use.\nThe ExperienceWeaver framework consists of\nthree components, including two stages of experi-\nence weaving. In Stage 1: Weaving for Experi-\nence, raw heterogeneous feedback is transformed\ninto a structured experience pool.\nIn Stage 2:\nWeaving for Retrieval, this pool is reorganized\ninto error-specific tips and functional strategies. Fi-\nnally, a customized retriever integrates the layered\nexperiences into the agentic pipeline. Details of\neach stage and the retriever design are provided in\nthe following subsections.\n3.1.1\nStage 1: Weaving for Experience\nStage 1 follows a “discover–simplify” paradigm\nand consists of two main steps: Experience Ab-\nstraction and Experience Combination.\nExperience Abstraction The first step is to\ntransform raw feedback into structured experience\nthat is useful to the system. Typically, feedback\ncontains descriptions of revision strengths, weak-\nnesses, or insufficiencies, which cannot directly\nformulate task-related experience. Thus, we define\nan LLM-based Experience Abstractor LLMabstract\nthat distills feedback, such as evaluation results and\ncomments, into experience units.\nFormally, given a set of raw feedback records\n{f1, f2, . . . , fn}, we define an abstraction func-\ntion:\nEa\ni = LLMabstract(fi),\ni = 1, . . . , n\nEach Ea\ni is then grouped by evaluation metric\nm ∈M, producing an initial set of experiences\n{Ea\ni,m} for each record and metric. In total, there\nwill be Nrecords × Nm sets of experience, each\ntypically contains 5 to 8 experience of 50 words.\nAlthough these experiences capture finite details,\nmany records may generate overlapping distilled\nexperiences. This motivates the second step: com-\nbination.\nExperience Combination The next step is to\nmerge similar experiences across records using a\nhierarchical method. We introduce a hyperparam-\neter, the group size NG. For each iteration, NG\nexperiences are grouped together and passed to a\ncombination function:\nEc\nj = LLMcombine({Ea\ni1, Ea\ni2, . . . , Ea\niNG}),\nwhere LLMcombine, and j = groups in tree. This\nstep merges overlapping experiences while pre-\nserving concrete details. This process follows a\ntree-based format, continuing until the remaining\nnodes are fewer than NG.\nThe final output is a set of unique and informa-\ntive experiences tailored to each feedback dimen-\nsion. In practice, this ends up with approximately\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "10 distilled experiences per metric, each ranging\nfrom 100 to 300 words.\n3.1.2\nStage 2: Weaving for Retrieval\nFrom an agentic perspective, experience should\nnot only reflect evaluation metrics but also sup-\nport text improvement phases such as error detec-\ntion, revision, and self-critique. In Stage 2, Experi-\nenceWeaver re-weaves distilled experience across\nmetrics into two layers: error-specific tips and func-\ntional strategies.\nError-Specific Tips with Supporting Cases\nError detection is fundamental to text improvement,\nrequiring tips that specify what is incorrect and\nhow to revise it. This step aggregates experiences,\ndenoted as Ec, across metrics. Formally,\nTp,e = LLMtips(Ec, phase = p, error = e)\nwhere p ∈{Detection, Revision, Self-Critique}\nand e denotes the error type.\nTo balance completeness and conciseness, we\nintroduce a hyperparameter τe controlling the min-\nimum error frequency for weaving. For instance,\nτe = 0.1 includes only errors occurring in more\nthan 10% of records. In practice, this produces 5–8\ndistilled experiences per error type (50–100 words\neach) across 20–30 distinct error types.\nFunctional Strategies Beyond detailed tips, a\nhigher-level layer is added to provide concise strate-\ngies that guide the preferred style of generation\nacross the three phases. Formally:\nSp = LLMstrategy(\nX\ne\nTp,e, phase = p)\nwhere Sp denotes the functional strategy for phase\np.\nTypically, this process produces 2–4 strategies\nper phase, each approximately 50 words in length.\nTogether, the error-specific tips and functional\nstrategies form a layered retrieval structure that\nsupports error detection, revision, and self-critique.\n3.1.3\nExperience retriever\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, the experience context\nis retrieved according to the current phase p, and\nthe error type e, being processed. This ensures that\nthe agent receives guidance at multiple levels of\ngranularity.\nTo regulate the amount of information provided,\nwe introduce a hyperparameter τt, which controls\nthe maximum number of tips injected into the con-\ntext. Adjusting τt balances informativeness against\nconciseness, allowing the system to avoid redun-\ndancy while still delivering sufficient detail.\nInput:\n• For phase 𝒑∈{𝑫𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏, 𝑹𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏, 𝑺𝒆𝒍𝒇−𝑪𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒒𝒖𝒆} \n• For detected error type 𝒆\n========Strategy for Quality Control ========\n1.

All agents\nand the orchestrator share the same base model.\nFollowing the ReAct paradigm, the orchestrator\nautomatically determines when to activate detec-\ntion and revision agents.\nOn the revision side, three specialized agents are\ncoordinated by an independent orchestrator, each\nconnected to memory, RAG, and experience re-\ntrieval: (1) Error Detection, which identifies mis-\ntakes and specifies error types; (2) Revision, which\ngenerates improved text incorporating detected er-\nrors; and (3) Self-Critique, which evaluates re-\nvisions and regenerates outputs if the score falls\nbelow 0.6, up to three iterations.\n3.2.2\nMulti-dimensional Feedback as a\nTeacher\nWe also adopt agentic settings on the evaluation\nside, creating a feedback environment that serves\nas a teacher for the evolving agent system. The\naim is to support multi-dimensional improvements\nrather than one-dimensional gains.\nFour feedback dimensions are considered: (1)\nCorrectness, whether revisions are accurate and\nconsistent with identified errors; (2) Formatting,\nadherence to predefined rules ensuring standard-\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "ized evaluation; (3) Meaningfulness, whether revi-\nsions convey clinically relevant information with-\nout unnecessary additions; and (4) Readability,\nwhether clarity and usability for practitioners are\nimproved.\nAll feedback is generated by the same underly-\ning models with dimension-specific prompts. De-\ntailed prompt designs and examples are provided\nin Appendix A.7.\n4\nExperimental Setups\n4.1\nDatasets\nWe used four clinical text datasets in English and\nChinese, covering both structured and unstructured\nformats: (1) MIMIC Radiology Report (Johnson\net al., 2024), 200 English chest X-ray reports from\na benchmark database; (2) MIMIC Discharge (El-\ngaar et al., 2024), 200 English discharge summaries\nrepresenting semi-structured patient outcome doc-\numents; (3) MIMIC Free Text (Johnson et al.,\n2023), 200 English unstructured clinical notes of\nvariable length; and (4) In-house Radiology Re-\nport, 200 Chinese abdominal CT reports collected\nin 2025 from a hospital in China.\n4.2\nEvaluation Protocol and LLM Judge\nReliability\nWe conduct the preliminary experiments on validat-\ning the LLM-as-a-Judge. Due to the vast amount\nof evaluation required, as it is necessary and in-\nevitable to introduce LLM evaluation. Accordingly,\nwe design a preliminary experiment for assessing\nthe stability and reliability of LLMs as evaluators.\nSpecifically, we define our observation model:\nYi,j(T, a) = µa + γT (a) + αi(a) + βj + ri,j(T, a)\nwhere, Yi,j(T) denotes the observed score, µa the\nglobal mean for attribute a, γT (a) the text effect,\nαi(a) the evaluator effect, and βj the iteration ef-\nfect. The residual ri,j(T, a) captures generation-\nlevel fluctuations.\nThe full statistical model is described in Ap-\npendix A.1. Validation experiments on 40 samples\nconfirmed that iteration effects are statistically in-\ndistinguishable from zero. Based on preliminary\nresults, we selected optimal base models as eval-\nuators, allowing αi and βj to be omitted from the\nobservation model.\nQuality improvement is measured as the score\ndifference between texts generated by the base\nmodel and those produced in the experiment. We\nintroduce a binary feedback indicator F ∈{0, 1},\nwhere Yi,j(T; F = 1) is the score after system evo-\nlution with feedback, and Yi,j(T; F = 0) is the\nscore before evolution. We adopt pairwise differ-\nence as the main indicator of model performance:\nDi,j = Yij(T; F = 1) −Yij(T; F = 0)\nwhere Di,j = 0 means no changes, and positive\nvalues means positive improvement.\n4.3\nSetups of Main experiments\nBaselines methods.\nFor the main experiments,\nwe adopted Deepseek-chat (DeepSeek, 2025a) as\nthe base model and evaluated ExperienceWeaver\nagainst two categories of baselines.\nFirst, to assess the impact of the experience\nweaver, we compared with state-of-the-art LLMs,\nincluding Deepseek R1 Search (Guo et al., 2025),\nDeepseek Thinking Mode (DeepSeek, 2025b),\nGemini-3 Pro (Deepmind, 2025), GPT-5.1 (Ope-\nnAI, 2025), and Claude-4.5 Pro (Anthropic., 2025).\nThese models directly revised raw clinical text\nwithout retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nself-critique, or experience injection.\nSecond, we included in-context learning base-\nlines, such as RAG with unprocessed memory, re-\ntrieval based solely on error similarity, and intrinsic\nself-critic modules performing iterative revision us-\ning internal knowledge.\nImplementation details.\nWe selected 200 sam-\nples from each of the four data sources and split\neach dataset 50:50 into training and testing sub-\nsets. Both subsets were processed through the\nbase model; training outputs populated memory for\nRAG-based models and ExperienceWeaver, while\ntesting outputs served as baselines for comparison.\nSystem hyperparameters were set to control Ex-\nperienceWeaver: weaving group size NG = 4, min-\nimum error frequency threshold τe = 4, and max-\nimum retrieved tips τt = 5. Ablation studies on\nhyperparameter sensitivity and performance impact\nare presented in Section 5.4.\n4.4\nSetups of Real-world Validation\nExperiments\nIn addition to the main simulation experi-\nments, we conducted a validation study involving\nhuman-labeled error detection to ensure real-world\nreliability. The dataset comprised 1,000 radiology\nreport errors, annotated in a blinded, head-to-head\nmanner by two medical experts (Dr. A with 10\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "years of experience and Dr. B with 6 years), serv-\ning as the ground truth. This dataset was split\ninto 500 training and 500 testing cases. During\nthe training phase, we selected γ1 correctly and\nγ2 incorrectly detected cases per error type, set-\nting γ1 = γ2 = 10 with a fixed woven base of 10.\nExperienceWeaver generated reflections on these\ninstances and applied hierarchical experience weav-\ning, producing distilled strategies and actionable\ntips for application to the test set.\nIn testing,\nwe evaluated three base mod-\nels,\nDeepSeek-chat\n(DeepSeek,\n2025a),\nMistral-large (Mistral, 2025) and GPT-5.1 (Ope-\nnAI, 2025) on 500 errors. To study the effect of\nexperience length, we introduced a hyperparameter\nτ ∈{1, 3, 5}, specifying the maximum number of\ntips per error type. Performance was measured us-\ning Accuracy, Macro-Precision, and Macro-Recall.\nA case study on Error Detection further illustrates\nhow ExperienceWeaver operates in practice.\n5\nExperimental Results\nThe experiments were designed to address the fol-\nlowing research questions:\n• RQ1: How can an evaluation framework be con-\nstructed using LLM-as-a-Judge, and how can its\nconsistency and reliability be validated?\n• RQ2: How can ExperienceWeaver effectively\ntransform multi-dimensional, extended feedback\ninto actionable experience, and to what extent\ndoes the learned experience enhance clinical text\nimprovement?\n• RQ3: How effective is ExperienceWeaver in\npractical small-sample clinical text processing\ntasks?\n• RQ4: What factors influence the effectiveness\nof ExperienceWeaver, particularly regarding the\nvolume of feedback and the granularity of weav-\ning?\n5.1\nRQ1: Evaluator Validation\nTo ensure the reliability of the LLM-as-a-Judge\nframework, we defined a statistical model and con-\nducted hypothesis tests on 40 samples. Full details\nare provided in Appendix A.1 and results in Ap-\npendix A.3. The analysis revealed two key find-\nings: (1) the LLM evaluator is sensitive to dif-\nferences across clinical texts, and (2) the average\nscore remains consistent when controlling for text\nand evaluator effects. These results form the basis\nfor subsequent experiments.\nWe then developed metrics to quantify bias, sta-\nbility, precision, skewness, and differentiability of\ngenerated scores. Definitions are provided in Ap-\npendix A.4. A diverse set of base models was eval-\nuated, including Mistral (Mistral, 2025), GPT-5\nMini, GPT-5.1 (OpenAI, 2025), Claude-4.5 Son-\nnet (Anthropic., 2025), GLM-Flash (Zeng et al.,\n2025), Gemini-3 Pro (Deepmind, 2025), Qwen-2.5\n7B, Grok-4,\nand DeepSeek-Chat (DeepSeek,\n2025a).\nFigure A.2 shows score distributions\nacross metrics and models.\nFigure 4 ranks model performance across quality\ndimensions. Mistral and GPT-5 Mini consistently\nplaced in the top four, with average ranks of 2.2 and\n2.8, compared to Claude-4.5 at 4.4.

Across all three\nbaseline models, incorporating experience yielded\nsubstantial gains, with accuracy, precision, and re-\ncall improving by up to 20.4%, 16.3%, and 28.6%,\nrespectively. A moderate level of detail (τ = 3)\nprovided the most stable performance.\nThis\nexperiment\nillustrates\nhow\nExperi-\nenceWeaver operates in scenarios where strong\nbaseline models fail to perform reliably on small\ntasks. Such models may struggle in specific small-\nsample cases due to misalignment between their\nintrinsic knowledge and the unique correctness\ndistribution of the task.\nExperience weaving\naddresses this limitation by distilling fine-grained\nreflections on individual errors into precise,\nhigh-level, actionable knowledge. This directly\nimproves detection accuracy. The effectiveness\nof this mechanism is particularly notable given\nthat the experience was derived from only 10 true\ncases and 10 false cases. A case study in figure5\nis provided to further demonstrate how woven\nexperience influences in practice.\n5.4\nRQ4: Further Analysis\nThe ExperienceWeaver framework includes several\nhyperparameters that shape its performance.

Bold numbers indicate the optimal performance. Percentage\nimprovements are calculated using the optimal score relative to the base model.\nChest X-ray reports under the main study settings,\nwith GPT-5 Mini and Mistral-Large as evaluators.\nAt the core lies a dual trade-off: preserving con-\ncrete details versus efficient abstraction in weaving,\nand ensuring sufficient injected experience versus\navoiding redundancy in retrieval.\nFigure 6: Performance across different group size\nFigure 7: Performance across different minimal errors\nComparing different weaving group size.\nThe\nsize of weaving groups determines number of unit\nfeedback are combined for abstraction in the first\nstage . It is expected that smaller groups preserve\nfiner detail, while larger groups may improve effi-\nciency in weaving.\nAs shown in Figure 6, increasing group size\nleads to diminishing improvement for the GPT-5\nMini evaluator, likely due to a loss of concrete-\nness when too much feedback is processed at once.\nIn terms of cost and time, token usage does not\ndecrease significantly with larger groups, which\nmight because input feedback remains constant\nand dominates the token. The primary advantage\nof larger groups lies in reduced processing time,\nwhich drops substantially as group size increases.\nTaken together, experience weaving is more ef-\nfective in hierachical structure than a parallel one,\nwith acceptable trade-offs in processing time.\nComparing different minimal error frequency\nto weave.\nThe minimal error frequency is a hyper-\nparameter in the second stage to set up threshold on\nfrequency for errors to be included. For example,\na threshold of 8 means that only errors occurring\nat least eight times are added to the tips dictionary.\nLower thresholds produce a broader pool but may\nreduce precision in retrieval. As shown in Figure\n7, higher thresholds tend to improve performance\nunder GPT-5 Mini as the evaluator. The results\nsuggest that focusing on highly frequent errors is\nmore effective and efficient.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this study, we introduced ExperienceWeaver, a\nhierarchical experience distillation and optimiza-\ntion paradigm for multi-dimensional text improve-\nment in small-sample scenarios.\nExperiments\ndemonstrated significant performance gains, with\nresults in some cases surpassing SOTA models.\nReal-world validation further clarified the mech-\nanisms of experience weaving, underscoring its\npractical value. We believe these findings support\nmore efficient adoption of LLMs and advance agen-\ntic approaches to text improvement.\n7\nLimitations\nWhile our study demonstrates the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework, several limitations should\nbe acknowledged.\nVariation across LLM-as-a-Judge models.\nDif-\nferent LLM base models, when used as judges,\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "exhibit distinct evaluation behaviors due to vari-\nations in architecture and training. Although we\nmitigated bias by selecting models with relatively\nstable and consistent patterns, residual variation\nremains. We conducted large scale preliminary\nexperiments on generated score, and hypothesis\ntesting and selected the optimal LLM as the base\nmodel.\nLimited sample size.\nOur experiments relied on\napproximately 200 training and testing samples per\ndata source, which is modest compared to typi-\ncal LLM studies. While in-context learning meth-\nods are well suited to small-sample scenarios, this\nconstraint limits generalizability. The results sug-\ngest that weaving-based methods can outperform\nmore complex model variants even under limited\ndata, but future work should explore scalability\nwith larger datasets to confirm robustness.\nPotential risks.\nEeploying LLMs for clinical text\nimprovement entails inherent risks. The primary\nconcern is the potential for “hallucination”, where\nthe model might generate plausible but factually in-\ncorrect medical details, or conversely, omit critical\nclinical findings during the revision process. Addi-\ntionally, there is a risk of over-correction, where the\nmodel might alter the physician’s specific stylistic\nnuances or intent in favor of standardized phras-\ning. To mitigate these risks, this system is designed\nstrictly as an assistive tool to support, rather than\nreplace, human judgment.

The\nresearch protocol received approval from the In-\nstitutional Review Board (IRB). Due to the retro-\nspective nature of the study using anonymized data,\nthe requirement for individual patient consent was\nwaived. Regarding the human validation study, we\nobtained written informed consent from all partic-\nipating medical experts, who were fairly compen-\nsated for their professional time and contributions.\nReferences\nAnthropic. 2025.\nIntroducing Claude Sonnet 4.5\n— anthropic.com. https://www.anthropic.com/\nnews/claude-sonnet-4-5.\n[Accessed 05-01-\n2026].\nBrian G Arndt, John W Beasley, Michelle D Watkinson,\nJonathan L Temte, Wen-Jan Tuan, Christine A Sinsky,\nand Valerie J Gilchrist. 2017.

Advances in neural information pro-\ncessing systems, 36:46595–46623.\nA\nAppendix\nA.1\nStatistical Model in Evaluator Score\nGeneration\nEvaluator determines the reliability of the exper-\niment results.\nThere are common doubts that\nLLM-as-a-Judge has intrinsic instability or biases\n(Thakur et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a). How-\never, \"Just-Ask-GPT-4\" (Zheng et al., 2023) still\nis a common paradigm in practice because of its\nconvenience and scalability.\nOur experiment allow certain fluctuations in the\nLLM evaluators. The mean thing is to make sure it\ncan generate stable output, with little fluctuations\nand random noise. To validate this, we design the\nfollowing statistical model and experiment.\nIn our scenarios, we build the following model\nto model the evaluation.\nThere are NT text samples, T1, T2, ..., TNT . For\neach text T, we evaluate it based on several at-\ntributes A = {ai : i = 1, 2, ..., Na}. For instance,\nA = {Readability, Formating, ...}. Each text T\nhas a unknown true attribute vector,\nθ(T) = (scorea1, scorea2, ..., scoreNa) ∈RNa.\nTo evaluate the attribute, we introduce Ne eval-\nuators. In this experiment, we repeat k times for\nevaluators on each text T. Therefore, we define\nthe observation Yi,j(T) be the evaluation results\nfor evaluator i, in iteration j.\nWe define our observation model:\nYi,j(T) = θ(T) + bi(T) + εi,j(T)\nwhere, Yi,j(T) is the observed score, bi(T) is the\nevaluator-specific bias (may depend on T), and\nεi,j(T) is zero-mean noise with variance σ2\ni (T).\nWe assume the following models to construct\nthe residual,\nYi,j(T, a) = µa + γT (a) + αi(a) + ri,j(T, a)\nwhere, µa denotes global mean for attribute a,\nγT (a) denotes text fixed effect, and αi(a) denotes\nthe fixed effect of evaluators. Then the estimated\nerror term becomes\nˆεi,j(T, a) := ri,j(T, a)\nA.2\nEmpirical Distribution of Generated\nScores\nFigure 8 presents the empirical score distribution\nacross four evaluation metrics. It illustrates the\nmean scores, standard deviations, and the relative\ncontributions of key factors to the overall score\nvariability, including text effect, rater (evaluator)\neffect, iteration effect, and residual variance.\nThe figure reveals that text content is the domi-\nnant source of score variation, which is desirable,\nas evaluation scores should primarily reflect dif-\nferences in the input text. An effective evaluator\nshould exert minimal influence on the score itself.\nFor instance, Qwen 2.5 7B under the Correctness\nmetric serves as a counterexample, where the base\nmodel alone substantially lowers the output score,\nindicating evaluator bias. Notably, the effect of it-\neration is minimal, suggesting that models produce\nconsistent scores across repeated evaluations. This\nconsistency is critical for ensuring score stability\nand reliability. Lastly, residual variance highlights\ndiffering levels of fluctuation across base models.\nIn our model selection process, we selected the\nbase models that minimize such residual fluctua-\ntions to ensure robust and interpretable evaluation\noutcomes.\nA.3\nHypothesis Testing for the Consistency\nand Reliability of Scores\nTherefore, we design the following hypothesis test-\ning procedures to verify the simulated evaluators’\n11\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "Figure 8: Score distribution across LLM models as base model.\nconsistency and reliability. The hypothesis are con-\nstucted with the following questions.\nIs the generated score stable? In our experi-\nment, we introduce multiple runs to validate the sta-\nbility of generation. In the above statistical model,\nit is equal to validate the effects of iteration βj.\nAs we expected iteration to be a random influence\nto the model, so we use random-effect model as\nβjN(µβ, σ2\nβ)\nH0 : µβ = 0.\nWe use t-test for the above model. Second, we\ncan also check whether the residual have equal\nmeans across runs. We can consider the run-wise\nmean residuals ¯rj =\n1\nNT Ne\nP\ni,T ri,j,T , and con-\nstruct a hypothesis testing as as follows\nH0 : E[¯rj] = 0, ∀j\nIs the generated score sensitive enough? An-\nother critical fundamental to ensure that the score\ncan represent the text quality is that text (T) is a\ndeterminant of score. Therefore, we can construct\nthe following test on whether texts differs in their\nmean scores.\nH0 : γT = 0\n∀T\nwhich can be tested using an F-test.\nHow does the base model affects the sensitiv-\nity and reliability of the score? To verify whether\nbase model will impact the score, we can construct\nthe following test\nH0 : αi = 0\n∀i\nH0 : V ar(εi,u,T |i) = σ2, ∀i\nFor the first test, we can leverage the F-test and\nfor the second test We can use Levene’s test on\ngrouped by base model.\nWith consideration of consistency and sensitivity\nof the generated model, we will find two base mod-\nels that is at the top of cost-performance frontier.\nA.3.1\nResults of Hypothesis Testing\nTable 3 and Table 4 summarize the statistical out-\ncomes. Based on the testing results, we can draw\nthe following conclusions with statistical support:\n(1) Text has a significant effect on average scores\nand contributes substantially to between-text\nvariance.\nThis indicates that the generated\nscores are sensitive to differences in text con-\ntent.\n(2) The choice of evaluator significantly affects\nboth the mean and variance of scores. This\ndemonstrates that selecting different base mod-\nels as evaluators inevitably introduces hetero-\ngeneity.\n12\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "Score Type\nText Mean\nText Variance\nRater Mean\nRater Variance\nRun Bias\nRun Stability\nRun Trend\nResidual Variance\nUsefulness\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\nCorrectness\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\nReadability\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✗\n✗\nFormat\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✗\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✓\nTable 3: Summary of Hypothesis Testing Results Across Score Types. ✗denotes to reject H0 and ✓denotes to accept\nH0\nScore Type\nText Mean\nText Variance\nRater Mean\nRater Variance\nRun Bias\nRun Stability\nRun Trend\nResidual Variance\nUsefulness\n2.92e-166\n0.000\n1.88e-46\n9.21e-20\n0.671\n0.122\n0.002\n0.004\nCorrectness\n2.44e-13\n0.000\n0.000\n1.39e-103\n0.499\n0.108\n0.001\n0.000\nReadability\n7.49e-294\n0.000\n1.24e-218\n7.28e-39\n0.996\n0.075\n0.000\n0.048\nFormat\n0.000\n0.000\n1.19e-79\n1.32e-52\n0.895\n0.783\n0.912\n0.619\nTable 4: P-values from Hypothesis Testing Across Score Types\n(3) There is no evidence that iteration effects shift\nthe average away from zero. This suggests that\nevaluators are consistent across repeated evalu-\nations of the same text under identical settings.\nThe evaluation itself remains stable despite\nthe influence of text and evaluator, highlight-\ning the potential of the mean score generated\nby simulated evaluators as a consistent and re-\nliable metric.\n(4) Residuals across the four metrics exhibit het-\nerogeneity. This shows that the four metrics\ncapture distinct dimensions of evaluation, even\nwhen assessed by the same simulated LLM\nevaluator.\nA.4\nPerformance of Different LLMs as\nEvaluator\nA.4.1\nMetric Definition\nTo rigorously compare the performance of different\nbase LLM models as evaluators, we introduce a set\nof diagnostic metrics derived from the proposed\nstatistical framework. These metrics are computed\nfrom the same experiment to the hypothesis testing.\nSubsequently, model comparison and selection is\nconducted by ranking models, and Figure 4 sum-\nmarize the ranking results.\nThe metrics are defined as follows:\nBias. Bias measures systematic deviations in the\nmean attribute values introduced by different base\nmodels. An ideal evaluator should align closely\nwith the collective consensus with values closer to\nzero.\nBias =\n\f\fαi(a)\n\f\f\nStability. Stability measures the consistency of\nevaluations across repeated iterations. We there-\nfore define stability measured by the variance of\nthe iteration effect, with smaller values indicating\ngreater consistency.\nStability = Var(βj)\nPrecision.\nPrecision measures the extent of\nrandom fluctuations in the residual of the model.\nTherefore, precision is measured by the standard\ndeviation of the residual term, with values closer\nzero denoting greater precision.\nPrecision = SD\n\u0000ri,j(T, a)\n\u0001\nSkewness. A balanced evaluation should avoid\nsystematic leaning toward either extreme of the\nscale. We therefore compute skewness, with values\ncloser to zero indicating balanced distribution.\nSkewness = Skew\n\u0000Yi,j(T, a)\n\u0001\nDifferentiability. Differentiability measures the\nextent to which a model distributes scores across\nthe available scale levels. We adopt the entropy of\nthe score distribution, with higher values reflecting\ngreater differentiation of scores.\nH = −\nX\ni\npi log(pi)\nwhere pi denotes the proportion of scores as-\nsigned to scale level i.\nA.4.2\nPerformance Statistics\nTable 5 reports the quantitative evaluation of nine\nbase LLM models across five diagnostic metrics:\nbias, stability, precision, skewness, and entropy. To\nsynthesize these findings, Table 6 presents the rank\nordering of models within each metric, together\nwith a total rank score obtained by summing across\nall dimensions.
