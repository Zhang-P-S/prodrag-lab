By definition, private information cannot be publicly shared. As a result, most\nprior work relies on small, narrowly scoped datasets—standing in stark contrast to the\n1https://privasis.github.io\n1\narXiv:2602.03183v1  [cs.CL]  3 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Preprint.\ndata-driven scaling paradigm that underpins progress in many other areas of AI (Li et al.,\n2025; Yukhymenko et al., 2024). Meanwhile, agentic systems (e.g., OpenClaw; Steinberger,\n2026, Gemini Agent; Google, 2025, and ChatGPT Health; OpenAI, 2026) increasingly need\nto process personal communications, documents, and records at inference time, while\nmaintaining privacy guarantees (Mireshghallah et al., 2024). This trend highlights the\nurgent need for robust privacy methods at multiple stages: input-side approaches like\ndata sanitization and minimization (Zhou et al., 2025; Dou et al., 2024), as well as post-\nhoc techniques (Bagdasarian et al., 2024) that ensure models appropriately handle the\npersonal information entrusted to them. Yet despite their apparent simplicity, these privacy\ntasks remain surprisingly difficult—current LLMs fail at even basic personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) detection (Shao et al., 2024; Pham et al., 2025).\nTo address this urgent need, we introduce PRIVASIS (i.e., privacy oasis), the first million-scale\nsynthetic dataset built entirely from scratch for privacy research along with its correspond-\ning parallel corpus PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION for text sanitization (Figure 1). Our synthesis\npipeline (Figure 1a; §2) achieves this scale without reference data by using auxiliary control\nvariables—profiles with personal attributes (e.g., name, ID), record types (e.g., “psychother-\napy billing statement”), and background contexts—to generate diverse documents spanning\nmedical, legal, financial, and communication records, each annotated with detailed JSON\nstructures. To ensure realism and diversity, we employ iterative rejection sampling with a\nweighted criterion combining LLM quality scoring and Vendi diversity metrics (Friedman &\nDieng, 2023). PRIVASIS demonstrates superior diversity compared to existing human-written\ndatasets: our domain subsets consistently achieve higher MATTR (lexical diversity metric;\n0.807–0.823 vs. 0.700–0.794), bigram diversity, and Shannon entropy while maintaining\nlower cosine similarity, indicating richer lexical variety and reduced semantic redundancy.\nWe evaluate models on a new benchmark derived from PRIVASIS by testing their ability\nto detect and sanitize private information across both vanilla and harder test sets. Even\nfrontier models leave room for improvement: GPT-5 achieves only 70% and 13% full\nsuccess rate on vanilla and hard sets, respectively. To tackle this challenge, we design\nPRIVASIS-SANITIZATION, a parallel corpus for training models to selectively remove or\nabstract sensitive information while preserving textual utility (§3). Our decomposition-\nbased pipeline (Figure 1b) breaks records into chunks, then applies targeted sanitization\nbased on user-specified attributes—going beyond fixed PII categories to support arbitrary\ninformation that users may contextually want removed.\nOur decomposition-based pipeline supports multiple abstraction levels (e.g., replacing\n“March 3rd” with “Early March” vs. complete removal) and explicitly preserves non-\nsensitive information through retention targets, yielding triplets of (original record, sani-\ntization instruction, sanitized record) that enable training lightweight models for flexible,\nutility-preserving sanitization. Training on PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION yields compact models\nthat outperform frontier LLMs (§4.3): our 4B-parameter PRIVASIS-CLEANER achieves 72.5%\nfull success rate on the vanilla test set, surpassing all tested models including o3 (70.3%),\nwhile maintaining competitive performance on the hard set (12.4% vs. GPT-5’s 13.1%).\nCrucially, these compact models enable practical on-device data minimization—removing\nunnecessary sensitive information before processing—which is essential since users cannot\nrisk sending private data to external servers for cleaning (Zhou et al., 2025).\nPRIVASIS provides the first privacy-safe yet privacy-rich dataset at million scale, overcom-\ning the fundamental data scarcity bottleneck in privacy research. Unlike prior work that\nrelies on real-world reference data or repurposed existing datasets, PRIVASIS is entirely\nreference-free—synthesized from scratch using only auxiliary control variables and public\nname databases—eliminating privacy risks from actual individuals. We validate this privacy\nsafety by sampling more than 1K profiles and querying whether they correspond to real\npeople: while some shared names or partial attributes with real individuals, manual verifi-\ncation revealed no genuine matches, with generated profiles being hallucinated rather than\nmemorized from training data. With its rich records and attributes, future work can leverage\nPRIVASIS to develop methods that respect privacy by design—from improved sanitization\nmodels to differential privacy techniques, and agentic systems that must operate responsibly\non sensitive information. We plan to release all code, data, and models to accelerate progress\nin this critical area where technical capability must align with ethical responsibility.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Preprint.\nPsychotherapy \nbilling statement\nIn response to an upcoming \ninternational trip for work, Natisha \nschedules a special session with Dr. \nRozen to address travel-related \nanxiety.

How-\never, directly sampling such complex, specific data x from LLMs is challenging, as they tend\nto favor high-probability, generic continuations rather than rare, highly specific instances\nof private information. This is particularly difficult without reference data, which most\nexisting works rely on to steer generations. To address this challenge, we adopt informed\ninitialization through auxiliary control variables, followed by a diversity-preserving revision\nalgorithm with selection. This allows us to efficiently explore the large space of possible\ntexts even in the absence of reference data. Figure 2 provides an overview of our pipeline.\nMore details and examples are in Appendix A and G.\n2.1\nSynthesis Pipeline\n1. Informed Initialization with Auxiliary Control Variables: We introduce multiple auxil-\niary control variables to guide the initialization of a text record x. A record is determined by\ntwo primary variables—semantic content (c) and structural format (f)—which are themselves\ninformed by three auxiliary variables (Figure 2):\n• Profile (i): Basic attributes such as gender, ethnicity, and date, sampled from a predefined\nset conditioned on the first name sampled from the US SSN applicant database.2 The\nprofile also includes attributes describing a specific event involving the individual.\n• Record type (d): Concise description of what the record is, derived from i.\n• Background context (b): Description of the social context of the record, derived from i\nand d.\nTo encourage diversity, we prompt the LLM to generate multiple candidates for d and b in a\nlist format and then select one at random. The record’s semantic content (c) is constructed as\nthe concatenation of i, d, and b, while its format (f) is generated given d and b. Finally, the\n2catalog.data.gov/dataset/baby-names-from-social-security-card-applications-national-data\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Preprint.\ninitial draft x0 is generated, given c and f. Because the process is bottom-up from explicit\nauxiliary variables, the variables serve as free annotations or metadata alongside the record.\n2. Diversity-preserving Iterative Selection-based Refinement: The initial draft x0 may\ncontain degenerate or overly generic content, while our goal is to produce records with\nrealistic and concrete details. To improve the quality of x0, we iteratively apply selective\nrefinement. At each step t, a candidate draft x′\nt is sampled and evaluated against the current\ndraft xt. An LLM judge compares which of the two drafts are better in terms of specificity\nand realism.\nWe find repeated refinement leads to a lack of variety converging to similar patterns. To\nmitigate this, we use the Vendi embedding score (Friedman & Dieng, 2023), which measures\nhow spread out a set of representations is in embedding space. Intuitively, the score is\nhigher when records cover a broader range of semantic directions, and lower when they\ncollapse to similar content. Concretely, we maintain a collection of all final accepted records\nproduced so far, and for each diversity evaluation we randomly sample up to nP records\nfrom this collection to form a pool P. The contribution of a new draft to diversity is defined\nas the change in Vendi score between P ∪{xt} (with the current draft) and P ∪{x′\nt} (with\nthe new draft). The final decision is based on a weighted acceptance score,\nS(x′\nt) = α · LLMScore(xt, x′\nt) + β ·\n\u0000Vendi(P ∪x′\nt) −Vendi(P ∪xt)\n\u0001\nwhere the candidate is accepted only if S(x′\nt) > τ with τ = 0.5. The refinement procedure is\nrepeated for up to three steps. Ablation study of our pipeline are provided in Appendix A.1.\n3. Attribute Annotation: After the final refinement step, we extract and annotate additional\nattributes in JSON format that are present in the record but not explicitly captured in\nthe profile i (e.g., fine-grained details mentioned in the text). These attributes and i are\nthen grouped into semantic clusters using an LLM (i.e., grouped attributes). For example\nin medical records, ‘clinic name’, ‘pharmacy name’, and ‘room number’ clustered under\n‘location’. Such groupings yield contextual structure that can be leveraged in downstream\ntasks, including sanitization (§3.1).\n4. Filtering: We filter out cases where any type of error occurred during the generation\nprocess, yielding a success rate of approximately 94%. Because the initial drafts of the\nrecords are refined, most appear reasonable. Nonetheless, we exclude records with fewer\nthan 64 words (66,894 in total), profiles with an age under 18 (1,180), and degenerate cases\n(1,232).\n2.2\nStatistics & Analysis\nBasic Statistics: PRIVASIS comprises 1,414,871 records with 55,092,084 annotated attributes\n(≈39 per record). These span basic profile details (e.g., name, sex, age, marital status,\nincome, language, blood type, phone, email, URL) as well as richer information such as\ndates and locations. Attributes are grouped into an average of 6.2 clusters per record, each\nwith 6.3 attributes. Records also include background context, format, and type descriptions\naveraging 527.0, 76.4, 41.8, and 20.0 words, respectively. Most records are generated by GPT-\nOSS-120B (67.9%; OpenAI, 2025), followed by GPT-4.1-Mini (21.6%) and Exaone-3.5-32B\n(7.2%; Research et al., 2024). Smaller shares come from Qwen3-80B (1.1%; Yang et al., 2025),\nLlama-3.3-70B (1.1%; Grattafiori et al., 2024), GPT-4.1 (0.7%), and other frontier models\n(<0.1%). Using multiple models both increases stylistic and distributional diversity and\nshows that our pipeline generalizes across LLMs.\nDistribution of Generated Profiles: The sex distribution is 59% female and 41% male.\nThe age, income class, and blood type distributions are uniform, as these attributes were\nrandomly sampled. The ethnicity distribution is shown in Figure 3 in the Appendix. The\nmost common ethnicity is South Asian, followed by European and Black. It should be noted\nthat these categories are generated by the LLMs; hence, the granularity of the ethnicity\nlabels is heterogeneous. For example, European refers to a region-based category, whereas\nBlack is defined in terms of phenotype. We also found a large proportion of profiles were\nnon-U.S. (95%). This is because we only use first names from the U.S. SSN database, which\nreflects a highly diverse population.\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Preprint.\nTable 1: Distribution of domain categories in PRIVASIS with the top three subcategories for\neach main category.

We therefore re-categorize them into broader groups (e.g., medical\ncare) using GPT-4.1-Mini on a random sample of 48K records (prompt in Appendix A.1),\nyielding 592 unique categories. These were hierarchically clustered with Claude Sonnet\n4 and manually refined into 10 primary categories and 42 subcategories. Table 1 shows\nthe distribution of the main categories along with the top 3 subcategories within each of\nthe main category. Health & Wellness is the most common category (20.7%), followed by\nGovernment & Civic (13.5%) and Business & Finance (13.4%). See Appendix G for example\nrecords and metadata (e.g., attributes) per category.\nHow does PRIVASIS compare to human-written datasets? Table 2 reports four quantitative\ndiversity metrics: Moving-average TTR (MATTR; Covington & McFall, 2010), bigram diver-\nsity, Shannon entropy, and cosine similarity. We compare each PRIVASIS domain subset with\nits related human-written dataset. PRIVASIS subsets consistently exhibit greater diversity\nthan human-written datasets across multiple metrics. MATTR and bigram diversity are\nhigher across PRIVASIS domains, reflecting richer vocabulary and syntactic variation, while\nhigher Shannon entropy indicates more uniform word use and less repetition. Additionally,\nPRIVASIS subsets achieve lower cosine similarity scores, confirming decreased redundancy\nand greater semantic diversity within the dataset.\nWe also conducted a human evaluation of the naturalness and coherence of the records in\nPRIVASIS. Specifically, we randomly sampled 128 records from PRIVASIS and 128 records\nfrom the collection of human-written datasets spanning a wide range of domains similar to\nthose in PRIVASIS. Seven annotators judged whether each record was natural and coherent\nin a blind review setting, without knowledge of the text’s source. Among the 128 records\nfrom PRIVASIS, 113 were judged natural and coherent, compared to 111 from the human-\nwritten datasets. This indicates that records in PRIVASIS achieve a level of naturalness and\ncoherence comparable to human-written records.\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "Preprint.\nDo the generated profiles correspond to real people? We sample 100 profiles to investi-\ngate whether they correspond to memorized real-world data. Using Gemini-2.5-Pro Deep\nResearch, we check if each profile matched a real person, providing full details (name,\nage, sex, citizenship, email, URLs, phone). In case of URLs, none of them were accessible.\nOf the 100 profiles, 5 were incomplete due to off-topic responses. In 15 cases, the model\nreturned multiple potential matches, which we manually disambiguated: 8 shared the exact\nname and 7 had similar names, but other attributes (sex, age, nationality) did not align,\nand no email addresses matched. In 3 cases, the model reported an exact match (name, sex,\nnationality), but manual review showed major discrepancies in age and contact information.\nThe remaining profiles were all reported as fabricated. We also run a larger check on 1K\nprofiles with websearch-enabled GPT-5 and none of them were judged to be real. Thus, the\nprofiles are synthetic and do not represent real individuals, reducing privacy concerns.\n3\nBuilding a Sanitization Parallel Corpus\nAs one concrete downstream application that leverages PRIVASIS, we focus on training\na sanitization model that can selectively remove or abstract sensitive information while\npreserving coherence and utility. We aim to train a model that meets the following four\ngoals: (1) process diverse text domains, (2) follow arbitrary sanitization instructions rather\nthan being limited to fixed personally identifiable information (PII) categories, (3) support\nmultiple levels of abstraction beyond simple masking or deletion, and (4) remain lightweight\nenough for local deployment.\nUsing PRIVASIS, we build PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION, a high-quality sanitization corpus of\ntriplets (original record, instruction, sanitized record) that treats sensitivity as contextual and\nsupports flexible strategies that balance privacy with utility. It is desirable for sanitization\nmodels to be small enough to run locally, so that sensitive text never needs to leave a user’s\ndevice. However, we find that even frontier LLMs struggle with sanitizing long text records\neffectively (§4.3). To address this challenge, we introduce a decomposition-based pipeline\nthat breaks records into manageable chunks, enabling grounded and consistent sanitization.\n3.1\nSanitization Pipeline\n1. Decomposition: To make sanitization tractable, the record x is recursively split into\na set of chunks C = {c1, c2, . . . } using double newlines, EOS markers, or other natural\nboundaries until each chunk satisfies |ci| ≤τ, where τ = 512 characters. This variable-\nlength decomposition simplifies the sanitization task while preserving local coherence (e.g.,\nlist placed in the same chunk).\n2. Target Selection: From the annotated attributes A of x, we assign a sensitivity weight\nwa to each a ∈A using an LLM, prioritizing highly sensitive information over relatively\nbenign details that are difficult to sanitize (e.g., happy emotion). Next, using these weights,\nwe sample a set of n targets, denoted T = {z1, . . . , zn}, which may be individual attributes\nor attribute groups (§2.1). Each z is then randomly labeled with ℓz ∈{ABSTRACT, DROP}.\nBy selecting targets stochastically, we go beyond PIIs to cover various information that users\nmay contextually consider sensitive.\n3. Sanitization: (i) For each target z ∈T , we first identify relevant chunks Cz ⊆C using\nan LLM. (ii) From each c ∈Cz, we extract the spans Sz,c that correspond to z. (iii) We then\nbuild a sanitization instruction instrz for z:\nIf ℓz = ABSTRACT, all c ∈Cz are concatenated\nand passed to the LLM to generate an abstraction instruction grounded in all the relevant\ncontext (e.g., “Abstract the specific date as ‘in the coming months’”).\nIf ℓz = DROP, we use\na fixed instruction (e.g., “Drop the information about {z} from the text”). (iv) We use instrz\nto sanitize each c ∈Cz for consistency. This decomposition-based strategy ensures both\nconsistent abstraction across chunks and improved efficiency, since sanitization can be\napplied to chunks in parallel. Finally, we merge the sanitized chunks to reconstruct the\nsanitized record ˜x. Further details are in Algorithm 1 in the Appendix.\n4. Final Instruction Generation: After sanitization, we prompt an LLM to generate a\nfinal coherent instruction bI based on all {instrz}z∈T .

We select K to minimize\ninterference with the sanitization process, choosing attributes with the lowest lexical overlap\nwith the sanitization targets T , based on ROUGE scores. When the grouped attributes\n(§2.1) are selected as targets, we occasionally omit the individual attribute names and only\ninclude the group label in bI, instead of iterating over the individual attributes. For example,\n“Please abstract all information related to locations while keeping the city.” rather than “Please\nabstract the clinic address, session room, and the patient’s address while keeping the city.” This\nencourages contextual generalization to natural user requests. Finally, the pipeline yields\na triplet (record x, instruction bI, sanitized record ˜x), which supports instruction-following\nfor sanitization. More details of our pipeline are provided in Appendix B.\n3.2\nStatistics & Analysis\nBasic Statistics: We construct a dataset of 100K examples and use 37K of them to build our\ntraining set, with 70.4% generated by GPT-OSS-120B (OpenAI, 2025) and 29.6% by Qwen3-\n80B (Yang et al., 2025). Sanitization instructions average 69.4 words and specify 2.9 targets.\nWe construct 2.1K evaluation records using latest frontier models (GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro,\nQwen3-235B, LLaMA-4 Maverick). Further evaluation details are in Section 4.2.\nComparison with Existing Privacy Datasets: Table 3 compares PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION\nwith existing datasets (extended analysis in Appendix F). Most prior work focuses on PII\nspan detection (Douglass et al., 2004; Pilán et al., 2022; Papadopoulou et al., 2022; Gretel.ai,\n2024; Zeng et al., 2025a), providing only deletion without rewritten alternatives, restricting\nto predefined PII categories, and operating in single domains with short text units. PRIVASIS\nrecords average 527 words, significantly longer than existing datasets, with annotated spans\naveraging 35.3 characters. The Self-Disclosure Corpus (Dou et al., 2024) spans average 28.7\ncharacters but provides only single-level abstraction for pre-specified categories in narrow\ndomains like Reddit posts. In contrast, PRIVASIS uniquely provides multiple abstraction\nlevels with flexible, instruction-based sanitization supporting unlimited user-specified\ncategories. Our dataset enables both removal and graded abstraction (e.g., “March 3rd, 2024”\n→“early March” →“this spring” →“recently”), covers 100K+ multi-domain records, and\ngenerates natural language instructions for arbitrary privacy requirements.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nModel Training\nWe train a sanitizer PRIVASIS-CLEANER that, given text x and instruction bI, outputs a\nsanitized version ˜x where target attributes are abstracted or removed. Since it is safer when\nsanitization models are run locally, we target lightweight Qwen3 models: 0.6B, 1.7B, and\n4B. We train them on a 37K subset of PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION (§3). Further details are in\nAppendix C.\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Preprint.\n4.2\nHierarchical Evaluation\nWe evaluate models on the PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION test set, which contains records from\nfour frontier models: Gemini-2.5-pro, GPT-5, Llama-4-Maverick, and Qwen3-235B. To\nassess sanitization effectiveness, we use a hierarchical evaluation framework capturing\nthree information leakage types in sanitized text: (1) direct leak, (2) inference leak, and (3)\nproximity leak. Our evaluation setup relies on exact string matching and factual questions\nto minimize potential evaluator bias. The LLM evaluator is used to answer those factual\nquestions, instead of preference based judgments.\nFirst, we check for direct leak by performing exact string matching to determine whether\nthe target attribute value zvalue appears verbatim in the sanitized record. If absent, we test\ninference leak by prompting an evaluator LLM (GPT-OSS-120B) to predict the attribute\nvalue given only the sanitized text and attribute key zkey (e.g., “Please guess the name of\nthe journal. Make a guess even if it’s not included in the given text.”). We denote this\nprediction as ˆzsanitized and check for exact string matches with zvalue. If no match occurs,\nwe check proximity leak by comparing the evaluator’s predictions from both the sanitized\ntext (ˆzsanitized) and the original record (ˆzoriginal). The evaluator assesses which prediction\nis closer to the true attribute value zvalue; if ˆzsanitized is as close as, or closer than, ˆzoriginal,\nthis indicates a proximity leak and thus a sanitization failure. The sanitization of a record\nsucceeds only if no target attributes T exhibit leakage (the Successful Record metric). This\napproach captures multiple levels of leakage from explicit disclosure to subtle inference.\nSince a model returning an empty string would avoid all leakage, we also measure informa-\ntion retention. For each record, we check whether the retention target attributes (K; §3.1)\nremain in the sanitized record using exact string matching and LLM. A record is considered\nsuccessfully processed only if no information leakage occurs for any sanitization target and\nall retention target attributes are preserved in the sanitized text (the Full Successful Record\nmetric). We also report Successful Attribute and Successful Att./Record metrics, which indicate\nthe overall success rate across all attributes in the test set and the average success rate of\nattributes within each record, respectively.\nWe release two test sets: (1) Vanilla and (2) Hard. The vanilla set (1,042 records) consists of\nrecords on which our sanitization pipeline (§3) achieves a perfect Full Successful Record\nscore, while the hard set (1,149 records) contains records where even our decomposition-\nbased pipeline fails to do so. The difference lies mainly in grouped attributes: 60% in vanilla\nvs. 87% in hard, which require contextual target identification, thereby adding an extra layer\nof complexity. Hard-set records are also longer (619.6 vs. 569.3 words) and paired with\nlonger instructions (94 vs. 57.2 words), reflecting higher complexity. Further details and\nexamples of each leakage type are in Appendix D and E.\n4.3\nResults on PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION\nOverall Performance: Table 4 shows results on both the Vanilla and Hard test sets.\n(1) Vanilla test set: Sanitization is fundamentally a re-writing task, yet even the strongest\nfrontier models fall short of perfect performance, with Full Success Record rates ranging\nfrom 64.4% (Qwen3-235B) to 70.3% (o3). Note, the Vanilla Test set corresponds to a subset\nof PRIVASIS where our decomposition-based sanitization pipeline with GPT-4.1 achieves\na perfect score. This gap indicates that frontier models even with reasoning capabilities\nstruggle to reliably execute fine-grained sanitization. In contrast, PRIVASIS-CLEANER-4B,\ntrained on PRIVASIS, achieves 72.50%, outperforming all frontier LLMs despite being orders\nof magnitude smaller. Even PRIVASIS-CLEANER-0.6B model, outperforms GPT-OSS-120B,\nLlama-4 Maverick, and Qwen3-235B, while the base models Qwen3 4B and 0.6B lags at\n53.65% and 16.70%, respectively.\n(2) Hard test set: Performance declines sharply for all models on the Hard test set, which\nintroduces more challenging attribute selections and longer contexts.

These results underscore both the challenge of fine-grained\nsanitization and the effectiveness of our dataset.\nSanitization Metrics & Retention Metrics: Although the Successful Record scores for most\nmodels are around 70%, their Successful Attribute/Record scores exceed 90%. This gap\nreveals a critical weakness: while models sanitize the majority of attributes, they routinely\nmiss at least one per record. For example, although the Successful Attribute score for our\nmodel is lower than o3 and same with GPT-5, the full success record rate of our model is\nhigher. Such failures are unacceptable in privacy-sensitive settings, because one missed\nattribute is enough to compromise the entire record, no matter how many others were\nsanitized correctly. Frontier models also underperform on retention, frequently over-editing\nand altering non-target attributes. For example, GPT-5 retains only 93.4% of attributes on\nthe Vanilla set, versus 99.2% for PRIVASIS-CLEANER-4B. These highlight a core weakness of\nfrontier LLMs: reliably separating sensitive from non-sensitive information.\n4.4\nAnalysis\nHow robust is the LLM-based proximity leak evaluation? We run human evaluation on\nall proximity leak failure cases (n = 140) produced by the o3 model and found 98% of\nthem to be correct, indicating the high precision of our evaluation setup. We additionally\nassessed robustness by repeating the proximity leak evaluation using two different models\n(GPT-OSS-120B and Qwen3-80B), achieving a high inter-model agreement of 97% over 5K\ncases, indicating low susceptibility to evaluator-specific bias.\nWhat types of information leakage do the models make? Table 5 reports the information\nleakage patterns (§4.2) of models on the Vanilla test set of PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION. Strik-\ningly, all models most frequently exhibit direct leaks, exposing sensitive information in\nverbatim form in the supposedly “sanitized” outputs. Our PRIVASIS-CLEANER-4B model\nachieves the third-lowest ratio of direct leak, following GPT-OSS-120B and o3. In contrast,\nthe base 4B model shows the highest ratio, indicating that training on our dataset improves\ninformation leakage patterns as well. GPT-OSS-120B shows the lowest direct leak ratio,\nsuggesting it can better identify the target attributes for sanitization; however, it ultimately\nfails to sanitize them effectively, as reflected by its Successful Record score in Table 4. In-\nterestingly, our PRIVASIS-CLEANER-0.6B model shows the highest direct leak ratio, but\n9\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "Preprint.\nTable 6: Top 8 main categories where each model fails and their ratio.\nModel\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\no3\nHealth &\nWellness\n(26.5%)\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(17.1%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(9.6%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(9.1%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(9.1%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(7.8%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(6.0%)\nProfessional\nServices\n(6.0%)\nDeepSeek R1\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(22.7%)\nHealth &\nWellness\n(19.2%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(12.0%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(9.9%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(8.6%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(8.1%)\nProfessional\nServices\n(7.2%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(4.9%)\nGPT-5\nHealth &\nWellness\n(22.3%)\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(19.1%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(11.0%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(9.7%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(9.4%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(7.3%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(5.3%)\nMedia &\nCommunications\n(4.6%)\nLLaMA-4\nMaverick\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(21.5%)\nHealth &\nWellness\n(17.5%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(11.8%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(8.8%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(8.5%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(8.3%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(6.9%)\nProfessional\nServices\n(6.7%)\nQwen3-235B\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(19.7%)\nHealth &\nWellness\n(19.5%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(11.2%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(11.2%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(10.2%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(10.0%)\nProfessional\nServices\n(5.8%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(5.1%)\nPRIVASIS\nSANITIZER-4B\nBusiness\n& Finance\n(15.2%)\nEducation\n& Training\n(15.1%)\nHealth &\nWellness\n(13.8%)\nPersonal\n& Family\n(13.6%)\nGovernment\n& Civic\n(13.0%)\nCommunity\n& Social\n(11.1%)\nLegal &\nCompliance\n(7.9%)\nProfessional\nServices\n(6.8%)\noutperforms Qwen3-235B on the Full Successful Record score.

The former primarily includes financial records,\nwhile the latter covers medical records. A notable pattern is that our PRIVASIS-CLEANER\nmodel exhibits a more balanced performance across categories, whereas o3 struggles dispro-\nportionately with Health & Wellness compared to other domains. Table 10 in the Appendix\nsummarizes the top 8 attributes that models fail most often. We find the models struggle the\nmost with name-related attributes (e.g., last name, full name, and user handle), and dates.\nHow well does PRIVASIS-CLEANER generalize? We evaluate the performance of PRIVASIS-\nCLEANER-4B on the NaP² dataset (Huang et al., 2025), which includes high-quality human-\nrewritten text for sanitization, in a zero-shot setting. We follow the proximity-leak evaluation\nprotocol using the sanitization target information (i.e., sensitive profile information) pro-\nvided by NaP². Specifically, we prompt the evaluator model (GPT-OSS-120B) to judge\nwhether the original text or the sanitized text is closer to the sensitive information. If the\nevaluator judges the sanitized text is as close as, or closer than, the original text, we consider\nthat a leak.\nThe 4B model finetuned directly on NaP² achieves a low leak ratio of 10%. Our PRIVASIS-\nCLEANER 4B model, despite never being trained on NaP², achieves the same leak ratio\nof 10%.

Table 3 summarizes\nexisting privacy datasets (extended discussion in Appendix F).\nSynthetic Data Generation: Related approaches include differential privacy methods using\nDP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) or public-to-private pipelines (Mattern et al., 2022; Yue et al.,\n2023; McKenna et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a). Non-\nprivate methods include self-instruction (Wang et al., 2023; Hugging Face, 2025; Ye et al.,\n2025), targeted prompting (Gunasekar et al., 2023; Abdin et al., 2024), and automated\nrefinement (Nadˇa¸s et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2023; Jung et al., 2024), but rely on fixed prompts\nor seed data, limiting diversity (Havrilla et al., 2024; Jung et al., 2025). PRIVASIS generates\nmillion-scale datasets from scratch using auxiliary control variables and diversity-preserving\nrefinement without predefined prompts.\nPII Removal Datasets: Classic corpora for anonymization establish span-level detec-\ntion (Stubbs et al., 2015; Pilán et al., 2022), while recent work expands through synthetic\ndocuments and LLM interactions (Gretel.ai, 2024; Selvam & Ghosh, 2025; Zeng et al., 2025a;\nYukhymenko et al., 2024). These remain small-scale or domain-specific; PRIVASIS provides\nlarge-scale, multi-domain coverage with both PII and sensitive spans.\nData Minimization: Related work abstracts non-PII sensitive details through disclosure\nrewrites (Dou et al., 2024), naturalness benchmarks (Huang et al., 2025), LLM anonymiza-\ntion (Staab et al., 2025; Zeng et al., 2025b), and generalization strategies (Olstad et al., 2023;\nPapadopoulou et al., 2023). PRIVASIS unifies these approaches with fine-grained span labels\nand parallel abstraction/removal pairs across diverse document types.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduced PRIVASIS, the first million-scale synthetic dataset with rich private informa-\ntion, addressing fundamental data scarcity in privacy-sensitive research. Built from scratch\nusing auxiliary control variables and diversity-preserving refinement, PRIVASIS contains\nover 1M records spanning medical, financial, legal, email, calendar, and meeting domains.\nUsing this resource, we developed PRIVASIS-SANITIZATION with a decomposition-based\npipeline enabling small models (≤4B) to outperform frontier LLMs like GPT-5 and Qwen3-\n235B on text sanitization.We plan to release all code, data, and models, to stimulate research\nin privacy-preserving generation, controllable sanitization, and agentic systems processing\nsensitive data.\nEthics Statement\nThe primary goal of our work is to address a fundamental bottleneck in privacy-sensitive\nresearch: the scarcity of large-scale public datasets containing rich sensitive attributes.\n11\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "Preprint.\nMethodology and Privacy Safeguards\nTo bridge this gap, all data in the PRIVASIS dataset\nare fully synthetic and were generated entirely from scratch for research and evaluation\npurposes only.

Table 9 reports the\ndiversity metrics (as in Table 2) when specific components are removed. We additionally\nreport the Vendi score (Friedman & Dieng, 2023). Without the auxiliary control variables for\nrecord type and format, the semantic diversity of the synthesized records—measured by\ncosine similarity and the Vendi score—drops sharply, even though the diversity-preserving\nterm is still present. Similarly, when records are iteratively revised without the diversity-\npreserving term, semantic diversity decreases markedly. In contrast, our full pipeline\nwith diversity-preserving iterative refinement (§2.1) achieves significantly higher semantic\ndiversity compared to the variant without revision.\nDistribution of the Generated Profiles: Figure 3 shows the distribution of the ethnicity\nin the generated profiles. We find that East Asian, Latin American, Hispanic, and Mestizo\ngroups are particularly under-represented in PRIVASIS, compared to real-world demograph-\nics.

To this end, we leveraged non-U.S. LLMs in our data generation\nprocess, including Exaone 3.5 (South Korea) and Qwen3 (China). Although the primary\nlanguages of these models are not English, they perform well within our English-language\npipeline. Therefore, we expect them to perform as good as when they are prompted in their\nmajor language.\nTo validate this, we generated Chinese and Korean records with Exaone 3.5 32B, Qwen3 80B,\nand GPT-4.1 through our pipeline. We then conducted native-speaker human evaluation\nwith both Korean and Chinese reviewers. The reviewers confirmed that the generated\nrecords were coherent, contextually appropriate, and diverse (with cosine similarity scores\nof 0.34 and 0.36, respectively), making them comparable to English ones. These results\nsuggest that our synthesis pipeline can be directly applied to LLMs whose primary language\nis not English.\nB\nBuilding the Sanitization Parallel Corpus\nAlgorithm 1 describes our sanitization pipeline (§3.1) in detail.\n20\n"}, {"page": 21, "text": "Preprint.\nAlgorithm 1 Sanitization Pipeline\nRequire: Record x with attributes A; chunk threshold τ = 512 chars; number of targets n\nEnsure: Sanitized record ˜x and user-style instruction bI\n1: function SANITIZERECORD(x, A, τ, n)\n▷1) Decomposition\n2:\nC ←DECOMPOSE(x, τ)\n▷Split x until each chunk |c| ≤τ\n▷2) Target Selection\n3:\nW ←SENSITIVITYWEIGHTLLM(A)\n▷Higher wa for highly sensitive attributes\n4:\nT ←SAMPLETARGETS(A, n, W)\n▷Targets may be individual attributes or attribute groups\n5:\nfor all z ∈T do\n6:\nℓz ←RANDOMLABEL({abstract, drop})\n7:\nend for\n▷3) Sanitization\n8:\nfor all z ∈T do\n▷Chunk ops run in parallel within the same z, but run sequentially across\ndifferent z\n9:\nCz ←FINDRELEVANTCHUNKSLLM(z, C)\n10:\nfor all c ∈Cz do\n11:\nSz,c ←EXTRACTSPANSLLM(z, c)\n12:\nend for\n13:\nif ℓz = ABSTRACT then\n14:\ninstrz ←BUILDABSTRACTIONINSTRLLM(z, S\nc∈Cz c)\n15:\nelse\n▷ℓz = DROP\n16:\ninstrz ←FIXEDDROPINSTR(z)\n17:\nend if\n18:\nfor all c ∈Cz do\n▷Apply uniformly for consistency across chunks\n19:\nc ←APPLYINSTRUCTION(c, Sz,c, instrz)\n20:\nend for\n21:\nend for\n22:\n˜x ←MERGECHUNKS(C)\n▷4) Instruction Generation\n23:\nK ←SELECTKEEPATTRIBUTES(A)\n▷Optional: explicit ‘keep’ attributes for utility\n24:\nbI ←GENERATEUSERINSTRUCTIONLLM({instrz}z∈T , K)\n25:\nreturn (x, bI, ˜x)\n26: end function\nWhy select retention target attributes with the lowest lexical overlap with sanitization\ntarget attributes? If the retention target attributes are too similar to the sanitization target\nattributes, they often end up containing or overlapping with the sanitization targets. In such\ncases, if the model were to sanitize correctly, it becomes desirable to sanitize the retention\ntargets as well. This leads to worse performance of strong sanitizers. Ideally, retention\ntarget attributes should be chosen to be as semantically distant as possible from sanitization\ntargets. However, we find that current LLMs struggle with this task. Therefore, we resort to\nmeasuring lexical overlap using ROUGE.\nWhat is the optimal chunk size when decom-\nposing the text? When designing our saniti-\nzation pipeline, we conduct experiments with\ndifferent chunk sizes. Performance peaks at a\nchunk size of 512 and then gradually declines\nfor larger sizes. Smaller chunks (e.g., 128) lose\nthe surrounding context necessary for saniti-\nzation, while overly large chunks (e.g., 2048)\ncause the models to struggle, similar to the\nvanilla case without our pipeline. Therefore,\ndecomposing long text records into appropri-\nately sized chunks is crucial for effective sani-\ntization.\n30.00%\n40.00%\n50.00%\n60.00%\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nFigure 5: Sanitization performance for\ndifferent chunk sizes.\n21\n"}, {"page": 22, "text": "Preprint.\nC\nTraining\nWe finetune Qwen3 4B and 0.6B with DeepSpeed on NVIDIA H100s.

If no match\nis found, we then use the evaluator LLM (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) to infer the attribute value\n(ˆksanitized) from the sanitized text given kkey, and perform exact string matching—similar to\nthe process used for the sanitization target attributes (§4.2). If no match is still found, we\ndirectly query the evaluator to determine whether each k is present in the given sanitized\ntext and its corresponding ˆksanitized. If the evaluator responds negatively, we mark it as a\nretention failure.\nVanilla test set vs. Hard test set: Box 7 and 8 present samples from the Vanilla and Hard\ntest sets, respectively. In the Vanilla set sample, sanitization is relatively straightforward\nbecause the record contains only a single occurrence of the attribute, and the instruction\nis direct. In contrast, the Hard test set sample has much longer instructions that require\ncontextual understanding to determine which attribute needs to be sanitized.\nBox 7: Vanilla Test Set Example\nSanitization instruction: If the attribute is ’Gemalto token serial’ and the value is ’84213579’, replace\nit with ’Gemalto token serial: [MASKED]’.\nForensic Financial Analysis Narrative Filed by Central Bank of Russia Compliance Office\nCase File: Alleged Embezzlement from Moscow Regional Library Fund\nSubject: Tanah Kuznetsova, born 1944-04-08, Internal Passport No. 4509 327684\nInitial Whistleblower Tip:\nOn 2002-07-17 at 14:43, an anonymous whistleblower contacted the Central Bank\nof Russia Compliance Office via email from a Tor browser, alleging embezzlement of 1,200,000 rubles from the Moscow\nRegional Library Fund. The tip referenced suspicious transactions processed through Sberbank’s Kuznetsky Most\nbranch, specifically highlighting a series of wire transfers between November 2, 2001, and December 17, 2001.\nChronological Incident Reconstruction: The investigation commenced at 09:00 on 2002-07-18. Tanah Kuznetsova, a\n58-year-old married female with a middle income class and Slavic ethnicity, was identified as the primary suspect.\nAnalysis of Sberbank transaction logs revealed a series of 17 wire transfers totaling 1,200,000 rubles between 2001-11-02\nand 2001-12-17. The transactions originated from the Moscow Regional Library Fund’s account (40702810500000000001)\nat Sberbank’s Lubyanka branch and were routed through an intermediary account (40817810000000000002) held by\nKuznetsova at the same branch. The transfers were made in varying amounts, ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles.\nA detailed financial audit of the Moscow Regional Library Fund was initiated at 10:05 on 2002-07-18, focus-\ning on transactions between 2001-10-01 and 2002-01-31. The audit, conducted by OJSC \"Audit Consulting\" at ul.\nMyasnitskaya, 47, Moscow, uncovered discrepancies in the fund’s accounting records. Specifically, on 2001-11-02 at 11:17,\na transaction for 200,000 rubles was recorded under \"operational expenses,\" but the corresponding invoice (No. 4278)\nwas found to be falsified, with an altered vendor name and date.\nStatements from 14 witnesses, including colleagues and superiors of Kuznetsova, were collected between\n2002-07-22 and 2002-08-14. Witness testimonies corroborated Kuznetsova’s involvement in financial management and\nhighlighted her access to the fund’s accounting systems. Notably, a colleague, Natalia Petrova, reported that Kuznetsova\nhad accessed the accounting database on 2001-12-15 at 20:47, using her personal login credentials. Petrova also stated\nthat Kuznetsova had been responsible for reconciling the fund’s accounts and had expressed concerns about the audit\nprocedures.\nDigital transaction logs from Sberbank’s data center at 19/1, Bolshaya Dmitrovka, Moscow, were analyzed.\nThe logs confirmed that Kuznetsova had authorized the wire transfers on 11 occasions between 2001-11-02 and\n2001-12-17, using a Gemalto token (Serial No. 84213579) issued to her on 2001-06-21. The logs also revealed that the\ntoken was used to access the accounting system on multiple occasions, often outside of regular business hours.\nThe forensic financial analysis narrative reconstructs the embezzlement scheme as follows:\nbetween 2001-11-\n22\n"}, {"page": 23, "text": "Preprint.\n02 and 2001-12-17, Kuznetsova executed a series of unauthorized wire transfers, totaling 1,200,000 rubles, from the\nMoscow Regional Library Fund’s account to her intermediary account at Sberbank. The funds were subsequently\nlaundered through a series of transactions, involving 7 shell companies registered at various addresses in Moscow,\nincluding OOO \"Alpha Invest\" and OOO \"Beta Consulting\".\nKuznetsova maintained her innocence throughout the investigation, attributing the discrepancies to account-\ning errors. However, the cumulative evidence, including the detailed financial audit reports, witness statements, and\ndigital transaction logs, substantiates the allegation of embezzlement.\nThe investigation concluded on 2006-02-10, with the Moscow City Court issuing a full exoneration of Kuznetsova, citing\nlack of conclusive evidence. The court’s decision was influenced by the revelation that the whistleblower’s tip was\nbased on incomplete information and that key evidence had been tampered with, including the alteration of transaction\nrecords and the destruction of relevant documents.\nBox 8: Hard Test Set Example\nSanitization instruction:\nGeneralize all references to session date, session time, and clinic name;\ngeneralize all references to presenting issue, job stressors, and burnout factors including workload,\ninternal, and external pressures; and remove any references to ’Headaches, insomnia (4-5 hrs)’ and marital\nstatus ’divorced’ from the text.\n**Asmara Mental Health Clinic - Session Notes**\n**Client:** Sirley Tesfay (ID: ER-2011-847392)\n**Date:** September 21, 2011\n**Session Time:** 4:30 PM - 5:20 PM\n**Session Focus:** Occupational Burnout - Symptom Assessment & Causal Factors\n**Subjective/Objective:**\nClient (Pt.) presented with a flattened affect and psychomotor slowing, speaking in a low, monotone voice.

I’m just... empty.\" Pt. expresses intense guilt over this,\nfeeling \"like a ghost\" in her own family. She links the pressure to succeed professionally to her divorced status, verbal-\nizing a deep-seated fear of being seen as a failure. This makes her current inability to cope feel like a validation of that fear.\n**Professional/Cognitive Impact:**\nPt. described a persistent \"mental fog\" and difficulty concentrating on complex tasks. The joy she once derived from her\nwork has been replaced by \"a constant, low-grade anxiety.\" She reports being less patient with vendors and feels her\nprofessional relationships are strained due to her exhaustion.

The model successfully removed the 9:30 PM on 17 Sep part from the\nrecord. However, the evaluator was able to reconstruct this information from scattered cues\nin the record (highlighted in yellow): “the last lithium dose was taken at approximately 9:30 pm\non Saturday, 17 September 2022 (about 5 hours before the 12:40 pm blood draw)” (ˆzsanitized; §4.2).\nBecause our method relies on exact string matching to detect inference leaks, the reconstructed\nvalue did not register as a match. Nonetheless, the evaluator determined that the attribute\nclosely aligns with both the inference derived from the sanitized record and the original\nrecord (ˆzoriginal; “9:30 PM on 17 September 2022”). As a result, this case was marked as a\nsanitization failure. This again indicates that while the model removes explicit strings, it\nfails to block semantic inference, revealing a gap between surface-level anonymization and\ntrue privacy protection (Xin et al., 2025).\nBox 11: Proximity Leak Example\nSanitization instruction: Replace ’TSH 2.7 µIU/mL’ with ’TSH [specific numeric value] µIU/mL’, remove the\ninfo 9:30 PM on 17 Sep, and retain 98.3°F in the text.\nFailed sanitization target attribute = {last lithium dose time: 9:30 PM on 17 Sep}\n6.

I know this is only slightly above range, but I’m concerned given a few symptoms and\nsome recent changes in fluid and salt intake.\nCurrent treatment and dosing\n- Lithium carbonate: 900 mg/day for the past 23 days (300 mg at 7:30 AM, 300 mg at 2:00 PM, 300 mg at 9:30 PM ).\nNo missed doses in the last two weeks .\n- Last lithium dose before today’s blood draw: (approximately 15 hours pre-sample).\n- Psychotherapy: Weekly CBT sessions at Fortis as planned.\n- Other meds/supplements: Vitamin D3 2000 IU daily at 8:15 AM; B-complex capsule on Mon/Wed/Fri at 8:20 AM. No\nNSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, or herbal products.\nRecent factors that changed (past 5 days)\n- Hydration: Usual 2.1–2.3 L/day fell to 1.4–1.6 L/day. Yesterday (17 Sep) about 1.45 L. Likely due to being outdoors in\nthe afternoon heat without enough water.\n- Sodium intake: Switched to lower-salt meals this week; estimated reduction of 30–35% (from 2,600–2,800 mg/day to\n1,700–1,900 mg/day).\n- Sleep: Thu 15 Sep 4 hours (1:05 AM–5:10 AM); Fri 16 Sep 5 hours (12:30 AM–5:25 AM); last night 6 hours (11:55\nPM–6:05 AM).\n- Caffeine: Two strong cups of chai on Fri and Sat at 5:30 PM (more than my usual single earlier cup).\n26\n"}, {"page": 27, "text": "Preprint.\n- Activity/heat: Brisk 48-minute walk at Nehru Rose Garden on Sat (17 Sep) with more sweating than usual.\nSymptoms since Friday\n- Mild hand tremor (right > left), noticeable when holding my phone.\n- Intermittent metallic taste.\n- Increased thirst last night.\n- Mild nausea this morning; no vomiting.\n- No ataxia, no confusion, no visual changes.\n- Vitals at home today 7:10 AM: BP 126/78 mmHg, pulse 82 bpm, temp 98.3°F.\n- Weight: 63.4 kg (up 0.6 kg from last week).\n- No diarrhea. Urine output normal; slightly darker yesterday evening.\nKidney/thyroid history\n- 29 Aug 2022: Creatinine 0.89 mg/dL, eGFR 78 mL/min/1.73 m², TSH [specific numeric value] µIU/mL.\nQuestions and proposed next steps\n- Should I hold tonight’s 300 mg dose, reduce to 600 mg/day temporarily, or continue as usual?\n- Would you like an urgent repeat trough lithium level after increasing fluids and returning to my usual sodium intake? I\ncan come tomorrow, Monday, 19 Sep, around 8:30–9:00 AM for a true 12-hour post-dose level if I take the evening dose\nper your advice.\n- I can add serum creatinine, eGFR, TSH, sodium, and potassium with the repeat draw if you recommend.\nImmediate steps I can take\n- Resume consistent hydration (aiming for 2.2 L today unless you advise otherwise).\n- Return to my usual dietary sodium rather than the recent low-salt change.\n- Avoid NSAIDs and other interacting medications.\n- Monitor for worsening tremor, confusion, ataxia, severe nausea/vomiting, or new neurologic symptoms. If these occur,\nI will go to the Fortis emergency department.\nContact and identification\n- Name: Reilynn Kaur Singh, Female, 61\n- Aadhaar: 4382 7610 2954\n- Phone: +91-98172-46385\n- Email: reilynn.singh61@gmail.com\n- City: Ludhiana, Punjab\n- I am reachable by phone after 7:15 PM today, or by email anytime.\nThank you for your guidance, and I apologize for the urgency at this hour.\nI appreciate your continued\ncare.\nWith respect,\nReilynn Singh\nF\nExtended Related Work\nPrivacy-Preserving Synthetic Data Generation: A closely related line of work aims to\nrelease differentially private (DP) synthetic datasets. A common approach trains or fine-tunes\ngenerative models on the private data with DP-SGD (Abadi et al., 2016) and then generates\nsynthetic data samples for release (Mattern et al., 2022; Yue et al., 2023; McKenna et al.,\n2025). To reduce training cost, “public-to-private” pipelines such as Private Evolution\n(PE) repeatedly query a publicly trained generator and privately select or filter synthetic\nsamples so the released set approximates the private distribution while satisfying DP (Lin\net al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025a). These methods have shown encouraging\nresults in confronting the fidelity–privacy–compute trade-off (e.g., utility degradation at\ntight privacy budgets and substantial compute to attain high fidelity at scale). PRIVASIS is\northogonal: it neither trains private generative models nor privately filters samples. Instead,\nit constructs standardized datasets expressly for evaluating privacy-related tasks, providing\nstandardized, reproducible measurements that complement and can accelerate progress in\nprivacy-preserving synthetic data generation.\nSynthetic Data in General: In broader context, synthetic data has become a critical source\nfor training LLMs, particularly in domains where real-world data is scarce or privacy-\nsensitive. Prominent approaches include self-instruction methods, which bootstrap from\na small set of curated seed tasks to generate diverse instruction-following data (Wang\net al., 2023), and distillation techniques that capture reasoning traces from powerful teacher\nmodels like GPT-5 (Hugging Face, 2025; Ye et al., 2025). Other works create high-quality\ndocument data via targeted prompting (Gunasekar et al., 2023; Abdin et al., 2024), automate\nrefinement processes to produce task-specific datasets (Nadˇa¸s et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2023;\n27\n"}, {"page": 28, "text": "Preprint.\nJung et al., 2024), and synthesize millions of personas (Meyer & Corneil, 2025; Ge et al.,\n2024). Most methods typically rely on fixed prompts, seed data, or reference trajectories\nfrom data generators, which may constrain the diversity and novelty of the generated data\n(Havrilla et al., 2024; Jung et al., 2025). PRIVASIS goes beyond the existing methods by\nsynthesizing million-scale dataset entirely from scratch, using auxiliary control variables\nderived from basic profiles and iterative, diversity-preserving refinement, without using\npredefined prompts or existing reference data beyond a public name database.\nPII Removal Datasets and Methods: Work on direct identifiers focuses on span detection\nand redaction for names, addresses, dates, account numbers, and similar concrete fields.\nClassic corpora anchor the task with span-level labels and strict evaluation, e.g., clinical\nnotes from i2b2 and court cases in TAB (Stubbs et al., 2015; Pilán et al., 2022). Newer\nresources broaden domains and scale: Gretel releases synthetic financial documents with\ntoken-level PII spans (Gretel.ai, 2024), and large collections of LLM interactions come\nwith privacy-phrase spans to support lightweight, on-device filters (Zeng et al., 2025a).\nPANORAMA provides a large PII-laced synthetic corpus (Selvam & Ghosh, 2025), targeted\nfor memorization measurements and SYNTHPAI stresses privacy risks even when text\nlooks innocuous (Yukhymenko et al., 2024). Evaluation toolkits like PRvL then probe how\nwell modern LLMs actually redact PII without breaking meaning (Garza et al., 2025). As\nsummarized in Table 3, these efforts are valuable but remain relatively small or domain-\nbound. PRIVASIS complements them with million-scale coverage across domains and—with\nour split columns—explicit support for both PII spans and other sensitive spans, providing\nbroader supervision than PII-only corpora.\nData Minimization and Abstraction: A separate thread aims to keep meaning while\nreducing identifiability—abstracting or softening details that are not strict PII but still\nsensitive. Self-Disclosure introduces 19 disclosure types and paired rewrites that make\nposts safer without changing intent (Dou et al., 2024). NAP2 generalizes this idea into a\nbenchmark for naturalness-preserving rewriting using delete and obscure/abstract strategies\n(Huang et al., 2025). Span catalogs and risk indicators support graded generalization\n(Olstad et al., 2023; Papadopoulou et al., 2023), while LLM-based systems explore stronger\nrewriters—adversarial anonymization that iteratively removes attributes (Staab et al., 2025)\nand remove-then-restore pipelines for controllable sanitization (Zeng et al., 2025b). In\nTable 3, these appear under “Other Sens. Spans” and “Abstr. Pairs” rather than “PII Spans”.\nPRIVASIS brings both worlds together: fine-grained span labels for PII and non-PII sensitive\ncontent, plus parallel abstraction/removal pairs across diverse document types—enabling\nunified training and evaluation rather than bespoke, per-domain setups.\nOther Privacy Benchmarks for LLMs: Beyond spans, behavioral evaluations ask whether\nmodels use or leak sensitive information in context. CONFAIDE checks privacy reasoning\nunder contextual-integrity scenarios (Mireshghallah et al., 2024); PRIVACYLENS evaluates\nagent behaviors and finds leakage even with privacy prompts (Shao et al., 2024); SEMSI\nqueries for semantic sensitive information across families of models (Zhang et al., 2025b).\nThese benchmarks surface failure modes and defenses but do not supply the aligned, span-\nlevel supervision needed to train sanitizers. PRIVASIS fills that gap with million-scale,\nmulti-domain supervision—PII and other sensitive spans plus paired rewrites—so models\ncan be trained and scored end-to-end (see Table 3).\nG\nGenerated Examples\nWe provide example records and their associated metadata (e.g., annotated attributes) for\neach domain category (§2.2) below: Health & Wellness (Box 12, Table 11); Government & Civic\n(Box 13, Table 12); Business & Finance (Box 14, Table 13); Personal & Family (Box 15, Table 14);\nCommunity & Social (Box 16, Table 15); Professional Services (Box 17, Table 16); Education &\nTraining (Box 18, Table 17); Legal & Compliance (Box 19, Table 18); Media & Communication\n(Box 20, Table 19); Recreation & Lifestyle (Box 21, Table 20); and Technical & Operations (Box 22,\nTable 21).\n28\n"}, {"page": 29, "text": "Preprint.\nBox 12: Health & Wellness Record Example\nGood morning, Windsor,\nThis is a reminder from Aga Khan University Hospital that you have an appointment with Dr. Aisha Karim on Thursday,\n14 Aug 2023 at 09:30 AM (estimated 35 minutes) at our main campus, 3rd Floor, Aga Khan University Hospital, Hospital\nRoad, Nairobi, Kenya – Appointment Ref 87432.\nPlease bring all your current medication bottles (approximately 4 containers), your blood-pressure log, and a copy of\nyour A+ blood-type card for the family reunion at Kenyatta International Convention Centre, 2nd Floor, Nairobi, Kenya\non 20 Aug 2023.\nWe look forward to seeing you.

The first two months felt like a surge of exhilaration — my blood\npressure dropped from 138/86 to 122/78, and I could finally zip up my favorite teal dress (size M). Around week 12,\nanxiety crept in; I started counting every calorie and worrying about the “rebound” effect, which even made me lose\nsleep at 02:47 on several nights. My therapist helped me reframe those thoughts, reminding me that the anxiety was\na signal of my mind adjusting to a new body image. By week 20, I experienced a quiet confidence, especially when\nI completed the 10 km charity walk on 2022-06-28, raising R 2 849 for the local shelter. Yet the final week brought a\nbittersweet sense of loss — my daily weight-check ritual, which had become a comforting routine, was now a closed\nchapter.\nLooking ahead, I’m eager to set the next set of health goals but I’m uncertain whether to focus on building muscle\nmass (aiming for a 5 kg lean gain) or to maintain the weight I’ve achieved while improving flexibility (perhaps a yoga\ncertification by the end of 2023). I would love your perspective — do you think I should prioritize strength training with\na target of 3 × 45-minute sessions per week, or would a balanced approach with 2 × 30-minute cardio plus weekly\nPilates be wiser?\nWhat plans do you have for the coming months? Any new projects, travel ideas, or community events you’re excited\nabout? I miss our long chats over rooibos and would love to hear all the details.\nWarm hugs,\nNefeli Moyo\nPhone: +27 71 834 5692\nEmail: nefeli.moyo@example.com\n@nefeli_moyo\nhttps://nefeli-moyo.com\n34\n"}, {"page": 35, "text": "Preprint.\nTable 14: Metadata for the Personal & Family Record in Box 15\nBackground Context\nIn a cozy, rain-soaked Johannesburg apartment, Nefeli drafts a letter to her college confi-\ndante, Thandi, reflecting on the bittersweet moment when her 6-month weight-loss phase\nconcluded on 2022-07-10.\nRecord Type\nInformal letter typed on a personal computer and mailed to a close friend on 2022-07-14,\nstating “My 6-month weight-loss phase ended on 2022-07-10”.\nFormat\n**Structure:** Friendly opening\n→brief weather comment\n→clear statement that the structured period is over\n→discussion of emotional roller-coaster experienced\n→request for the friend’s perspective on next health goals\n→ending with an open-ended question about upcoming plans.\n**Tone:** Thoughtful and inquisitive.\nGrouped Attributes\n• Nefeli Moyo – Personal Identification Details\n– first_name: Nefeli\n– last_name: Moyo\n– phone_number: +27 71 834 5692\n– email: nefeli.moyo@example.com\n– user_handle: @nefeli_moyo\n– url: https://nefeli-moyo.com\n– full_name: Nefeli Moyo\n– city: Johannesburg\n– address: 27th Avenue, Linden\n– care_of_address: 12 Willow Road, Melville, 2001\n• Nefeli Moyo – Health & Medical Information\n– weight_loss_start_date: 2022-01-10\n– weight_loss_end_date: 2022-07-10\n– weight_loss_duration_months: 6\n– initial_weight_kg: 88\n– final_weight_kg: 68\n– weight_lost_kg: 20\n– dr_name: Dr. Lindiwe Nkosi\n– dr_license_number: R4G7Z9\n– therapy_sessions_with_dr: 42\n– blood_pressure_start: 138/86\n– blood_pressure_end: 122/78\n– future_lean_gain_target_kg: 5\n– yoga_certification_target_year: 2023\n• Nefeli Moyo – Fitness Activity Metrics\n– treadmill_distance_km: 1842\n– hiit_minutes: 3276\n– strength_training_sessions_per_week: 3\n– strength_training_session_duration_minutes: 45\n– cardio_sessions_per_week: 2\n– cardio_session_duration_minutes: 30\n– pilates_frequency: weekly\n• Nefeli Moyo – Family & Dependent Information\n– child1_name: Thabo\n– child1_age: 56\n– child2_name: Sipho\n– child2_age: 53\n• Nefeli Moyo – Charity Event Participation\n– charity_walk_date: 2022-06-28\n– charity_walk_distance_km: 10\n– charity_walk_funds_raised_R: 2849\n• Nefeli Moyo – Psychological & Sleep Data\n– anxiety_start_week: 12\n– sleep_loss_time: 02:47\n• Nefeli Moyo – Apparel & Appearance Details\n– dress_color: teal\n– dress_size: M\n35\n"}, {"page": 36, "text": "Preprint.\nBox 16: Community & Social Record Example\nDate: 2023-09-13\nWho was present:\n• Lamia Chowdhury (myself)\n• Mayor Abdul Karim\n• Councilor Farhana Siddiqui (Rajshahi Municipal Council)\n• Rahim Ullah, Representative, EcoRajshahi NGO\n• 12 volunteer residents (including my neighbor’s son, 19-year-old Arif)\n> \"The municipal waste management plan will roll out in three phases.\nPhase 1 (Q1-Q2 2024) will introduce\nsource-separation bins in all 14 wards, targeting a 30% reduction in mixed waste.

My journey in science began at an early age, inspired by the\nwind turbines along the Gulf of Finland and the solar panels installed at my family’s home in Lauttasaari (address:\nSärkiniementie 14, 00210 Helsinki). My curiosity about sustainable energy solutions has shaped my academic path and\nextracurricular pursuits.\nIn 2020, as a first-year student at Helsingin Suomalainen Yhteiskoulu (SYK), I joined the school’s science club, where I\nparticipated in my first group research project analyzing the energy efficiency of LED lighting in school buildings. Our\nteam measured a 27% reduction in electricity consumption over a 3-month period, using calibrated Fluke 287 multimeters\nand data loggers. This experience introduced me to the importance of precise data collection and collaborative problem-\nsolving.\nBy 2021, I had advanced to leading a student initiative to install a 5.2 kW solar array on the school’s south-facing roof.\nI coordinated with local company Aurinkotekniikka Oy, managed a budget of €4,800, and presented our findings at\nthe Helsinki Science Fair on 2021-10-22. The project reduced the school’s annual carbon footprint by 1.3 metric tons, as\nverified by the city’s environmental office.\nIn 2022, I interned at the Viikki Environmental Research Centre (address: Latokartanonkaari 7, 00790 Helsinki) for six\nweeks, assisting in a study on urban microclimates. I analyzed temperature and humidity data from 18 rooftop sensors\nacross Kallio and Pasila, learning to use RStudio for statistical modeling and ArcGIS for spatial visualization.\nMy most formative experience occurred in 2023, when I led a team of three in the Suomen Lukiolaisten Tiedekilpailu\n(Finnish High School Science Competition). Our project, “Renewable Energy Optimization in Urban Helsinki,” focused\non integrating wind, solar, and geothermal sources to maximize energy output in densely built environments. We\nconducted field measurements at three sites: the Helsinki Central Library Oodi (Töölönlahdenkatu 4), the Pasila Business\nDistrict, and the Jätkäsaari residential area. Over 11 weeks, we collected 2,400 data points on solar irradiance, wind\nspeed (using a Kestrel 5500 meter), and ground temperature profiles to model optimal energy mixes.\nMidway through the project, our team faced significant technical setbacks: a data logger malfunctioned during a critical\nwind survey at Oodi on 2023-09-17 at 14:30, resulting in the loss of 18 hours of data. Additionally, divergent opinions on\ndata analysis methods led to heated debates within the team. As team leader, I facilitated a structured conflict resolution\nsession at the Helsinki City Library meeting room on 2023-09-21, where we agreed on a hybrid approach combining\nregression analysis and machine learning algorithms (using Python’s scikit-learn library). This experience taught me\nthe value of adaptability, transparent communication, and resilience under pressure.\nOur project was awarded first prize on 2023-11-12, earning a €3,000 scholarship and a research internship at Aalto\nUniversity’s Department of Energy Technology. The jury commended our innovative integration of real-time data and\npredictive modeling, as well as my leadership in overcoming adversity.\nThrough these experiences, I have developed a strong foundation in scientific research, data analysis, and teamwork. I\nam eager to further my studies in environmental physics and renewable energy systems at the University of Helsinki,\ncontributing to the university’s vibrant research community and advancing sustainable solutions for urban environments.\nThank you for considering my application.\nSincerely,\nMaren Virtanen\n40\n"}, {"page": 41, "text": "Preprint.\nTable 17: Metadata for the Education & Training Record in Box 18\nBackground Context\nMaren submits her university admission application to the University of Helsinki Faculty\nof Science, highlighting her leadership role in the award-winning “Renewable Energy\nOptimization in Urban Helsinki” project, emphasizing how overcoming technical setbacks\nand team disagreements during the competition taught her resilience and adaptability as\na prospective science student.\nRecord Type\nUniversity admission application to University of Helsinki Faculty of Science\nFormat\n**Chronological Narrative Structure**\nPresents Maren’s academic and extracurricular journey in chronological order, culminating\nin her recent leadership experience.
