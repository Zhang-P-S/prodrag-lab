Prior work shows that LLMs can\ncondition their outputs on demographic informa-\ntion even when it is not task-relevant (Zack et al.,\n2024; Kim et al., 2023; Fraser and Kiritchenko,\n2024; Zhao et al., 2025), therefore can induce mis-\nattribution on model output with undesirable or bi-\nased behavior (Demchak et al., 2024; Levartovsky\net al., 2025; Zack et al., 2024).\nMost prior studies on demographic bias focus\non outcome-level effects, evaluating disparities in\ngenerated responses, accuracy, calibration, or tox-\nicity scores across demographic groups (Tan and\nLee, 2025; Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Guan et al.,\n2025; Wang et al., 2025).\nWhile these analy-\nses are essential for documenting harm, they treat\nLLMs as black boxes, offering limited insight\ninto whether demographic attributes are encoded\nas high-level semantic features, task-relevant rep-\nresentations, or spurious shortcuts during predic-\ntion. In parallel, recent works in mechanistic in-\nterpretability demonstrated how LLMs encode de-\nmographic information and manipulated internal\nLLMs’ states to ensure fairness (Yu and Anani-\nadou, 2025; Ahsan and Wallace, 2025; Karvonen\nand Marks, 2025), yet these tools have rarely been\napplied to demographic bias in a systematic and\ntask-diverse manner.\nA central challenge is that demographic at-\ntributes interact with language in complex ways.\nIn many real-world settings, demographic infor-\nmation may be explicitly stated (e.g., “a Black\npatient,” “a Hispanic speaker”) or implicitly con-\nveyed through linguistic, cultural, or geographical\ncues, i.e. the “proxy” cues. Moreover, the same\ndemographic signal can have qualitatively differ-\nent effects depending on the task: it may alter pre-\ndicted medical risk in a clinical scenario, while si-\nmultaneously modulating perceived toxicity, cred-\nibility, or intent in open-ended generation. Exist-\ning evaluation typically isolate a single task or do-\nmain (Hartvigsen et al., 2022; Zack et al., 2024;\nLevartovsky et al., 2025), making it diﬀicult to as-\nsess whether demographic sensitivity reflects gen-\neral representational mechanisms or task-specific\nheuristics.\nIn this work, we investigate how demographic\nattributes influence LLM behavior, with a focus\non mechanistic explanations rather than surface-\nlevel disparities. We examine race and ethnicity\n1\narXiv:2601.12868v1  [cs.CL]  19 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "as commonly occurring coarse-grained categories\n(e.g. White, Black, Asian, Hispanic and Latino)\nas they appear in the studied datasets, rather than\nattempting to model the full sociological complex-\nity of these constructs. Using two publicly avail-\nable datasets, we study: 1) toxicity-related gen-\neration tasks (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), where the\nsame attributes may alter the likelihood, tone, or\nframing of model outputs, and 2) clinical narrative\ntasks (Bear Don’t Walk IV et al., 2024), where the\nsame attributes appear through explicit or indirect\ncues in medical text and modulate model behavior\ndespite identical clinical evidence.\nWe adopt a mechanistic interpretability (MI)\nframework to study how lexical cues of race and\nethnicity are encoded and propagated within three\nopen-source LLMs that are widely used: Qwen2.5-\n7B (Qwen Team, 2024), Mistral-7B (Jiang et al.,\n2023), and Llama-3.1-8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024).\nOur contributions are threefold:\n• a reproducible MI pipeline that combines multi-\nclass probing, neuron-level attribution, and tar-\ngeted intervention to identify internal units asso-\nciated with demographic attributes and to exam-\nine their functional relevance across tasks. The\nproposed framework is applicable to other social\nvariables beyond race and ethnicity.\n• a fine-grained characterization of race and eth-\nnicity representations across LLMs, revealing\nthe distributed nature of demographic informa-\ntion and model-specific emphasis on semantic\nfacets such as geography, language, culture, or\nhistorical context.\n• a mechanistic analysis of how demographic rep-\nresentation influences model behaviors.\nAl-\nthough internal features encode sensitive or\nharmful stereotype-related concepts present in\npretraining data, these representations are un-\nevenly activated by direct and indirect demo-\ngraphic cues.\nOur findings show that while race- and ethnicity-\nassociated representations can be identified and an-\nalyzed at the neuron level, their associations with\nbiased model behavior persist even when highly ac-\ntive neurons are surpressed. This indicates that bi-\nased behavior in LLMs cannot be fully explained\nor controlled by manipulating a small set of identi-\nfiable neurons alone.\nClinical Note: {Text}\nInferred Race or Ethnicity:\nAsian\n𝑊!\"#$\n𝑊%&\nSwiGLU\nMLP\n𝑊!\"#$\nActivation Scores\nΣ\nNeuron vector 𝑣!\nℎ'\nMLP\noutput\nActivation Scores\nHigh 𝑎%(𝑥)\nfor target race\nLogit Lens Japanese, ⽇本, China, Nguyen\n亚洲, アジア, Shanghai\nIntervention\nSuppressed Activations\n𝑣%\nWhite\nAttention\nFigure 1: With MLP, we locate neurons relevant to\nrace information and inspect them via Logit Lens.

Our approach of using probe-based\nneuron localization aligns with emerging research\nin this space. Yu and Ananiadou (2025) utilized\nneuron editing to understand and mitigate gender\nbias, identifying specific “gender neurons” within\nthe MLP layers. In the medical domain, Ahsan\net al. (2025) investigated the mechanisms of demo-\ngraphic bias specifically for healthcare tasks, sug-\ngesting that certain internal representations are dis-\nproportionately sensitive to racial identifiers. More\nrecently, Ahsan and Wallace (2025) explored the\nuse of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to reveal clin-\nical racial biases. Our work extends these findings\nby demonstrating that race-specific neurons are not\nonly present in general datasets but are consistently\nactivated and influential on domain-specific text.\nInternal Bias Mitigation and Steering within\nLLMs. Beyond identification, recent work focuses\non manipulating internal model states to ensure\nfairness. Zhou et al. (2024) proposed the UniB-\nias framework, which mitigates bias by manipu-\nlating attention heads and MLP components. For\nreal-time applications, Li et al. (2025) introduced\nFairSteer, a dynamic activation steering method\nthat adjusts model behavior during inference. Kar-\nvonen and Marks (2025) further demonstrated that\ninterpretability-based interventions can improve\nfairness more robustly than traditional fine-tuning\nin realistic settings. Our methodology contributes\nto this line of work by providing a targeted interven-\ntion strategy, specifically sign-flipping and ampli-\nfication, to suppress biased pathways. This builds\nupon the “context-aware” fairness frameworks sug-\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "gested by Nadeem et al. (2025), ensuring that mit-\nigation is grounded in the semantic understanding\nof the racial directions we extract.\nRacial Bias in Clinical LLMs.\nExtensive re-\nsearch has documented that LLMs inherit and prop-\nagate racial biases when applied to clinical deci-\nsion support. Zhang et al. (2023) demonstrated\nthat ChatGPT exhibits disparate treatment recom-\nmendations for acute coronary syndrome based\non racial and gender cues. Similarly, Zack et al.\n(2024) evaluated GPT-4, finding that model fre-\nquently perpetuates harmful stereotypes that could\nlead to inequitable health outcomes. Poulain et al.\n(2024) further expanded this analysis across var-\nious clinical decision-support tasks, highlighting\nthat bias patterns are not idiosyncratic but system-\natic across model families.\nWhile these studies\nestablish the existence of bias, they largely treat\nmodel as a black box. Our work seeks to uncover\nthe internal mechanisms driving these disparate\noutputs.\n3\nBackground\nMLP Layers and Neuron Activation.\nMod-\nern Transformer-based LLMs process information\nthrough a residual stream. In this framework, the\nresidual stream acts as a communication channel,\nwhile MLP layers function as key-value memories\nthat store and inject factual associations into the\nstream (Geva et al., 2021a). Contemporary models\nlike Llama 3.1, Mistral, and Qwen 2.5 utilize the\nSwiGLU gated architecture (Shazeer, 2020). The\noutput of an MLP block with input x is defined as:\nMLP(x) =\n(\nSwiGLU(xWgate) ⊙(xWup)\n)\nWdown\n(1)\nwhere ⊙is the element-wise product. We define\nan individual neuron j as the j-th element of the\nintermediate gated state. The total MLP output is\nthe sum of these neurons’ contributions:\nMLP(x) =\ndmlp\n∑\nj=1\naj(x) · vj\n(2)\nwhere aj(x) is the activation score (the product of\nthe gate and up-projections) and vj is the j-th row\nof Wdown. Our method specifically probes these\noutput vectors vj to locate racial information.\nLogit Lens.\nTo interpret high-dimensional vec-\ntors in residual stream or neuron output vectors\nvj, we use Logit Lens (nostalgebraist, 2020). This\ntechnique projects a vector h directly into vocabu-\nlary space using model’s unembedding matrix WU:\nlogits = hWU. By inspecting top-ranked tokens\nin the resulting distribution, we can decode the se-\nmantic concepts encoded within specific neurons.\n4\nMethodology\nWe propose a mechanistic interpretability frame-\nwork to determine where and how race information\nis encoded within LLMs. Our approach progresses\nfrom identifying global race directions via multi-\nclass probing to identifying the specific neurons re-\nsponsible for these encodings.\n4.1\nLocating Race Directions via Multi-Class\nProbing\nTo extract race/ethnicity representations, we train\nlinear probes WRace to classify race/ethnicity cat-\negory membership for each model. The probe is\ntrained on the final-layer residual stream ¯hL−1, av-\neraged across all token positions:\nP(race = c | ¯hL−1) = softmax(W ⊤\nRace¯hL−1 + b)c\n(3)\nwhere WRace ∈Rd×|C| is the learned probe ma-\ntrix, b is bias vector, and C denotes the set of\nrace/ethnicity categories.\nEach column wc of\nWRace represents race direction for group c in\nmodel’s representation space.\n4.2\nFrom Race Directions to Neurons\nHaving identified the global race directions wc, we\nlocate the MLP neurons that write to these direc-\ntions, motivated by prior work showing MLPs act\nas key–value memories (Geva et al., 2021b).\nInterpreting the Probe Direction. We first ver-\nify that our learned directions wc capture mean-\ningful racial semantics.\nUsing Logit Lens, we\nproject each direction into vocabulary space via the\nmodel’s unembedding matrix WU:\nzprobe = WUwc\n(4)\nTop-k tokens (k = 20) with the highest values in\nzprobe serve as a semantic fingerprint for each racial\ngroup.\nIdentifying Candidate Neurons. To locate neu-\nrons that write to race direction, we compute the\ncosine similarity between each MLP neuron’s out-\nput vector vl\nj at layer l and the probe direction wc:\nScore(l, j) =\nwc · vl\nj\n∥wc∥∥vl\nj∥\n(5)\nAll neurons in the final four MLP layers are ranked\nby this score, and the top 20 candidates are selected.\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Each candidate is selected by projecting its output\nvector into vocabulary space and inspecting top-20\ntokens. Neurons are retained only if their tokens\nshow clear alignment with the target racial group.\n4.3\nValidating Neurons via Activation\nAnalysis and Intervention\nTo confirm that identified neurons encode mean-\ningful racial information and causally influence\nmodel behavior, we design a two-stage validation\npipeline.\nActivation Analysis. We measure how strongly\neach neuron group activates across different in-\nputs. For a given input text, we extract the acti-\nvation score of each candidate neuron during the\nforward pass. For ToxiGen, we average activations\nacross all token positions; for C-REACT, where the\nmodel must produce a classification, we extract ac-\ntivations at the last input token before generation.\nWe then compare activation patterns across racial\ngroups: if neurons identified for a particular race\nshow higher activation scores when processing text\nabout that group compared to other groups, this\nprovides evidence that these neurons selectively re-\nspond to race-related content.\nTargeted Intervention. To test whether identified\nneurons causally influence model outputs, we ma-\nnipulate their activations during inference. We im-\nplement this using PyTorch forward hooks on the\nMLP Wdown. During the forward pass, we inter-\ncept the activation score of each targeted neuron\nand force it into a strongly negative range. Specif-\nically, we multiply positive activations by a neg-\native factor (e.g., -5) and amplify negative activa-\ntions by a positive factor (e.g., 5). This makes the\nneuron’s contribution subtractive rather than addi-\ntive. This modified signal propagates through the\nremaining layers, allowing us to measure whether\nsteering specific neurons changes model behavior\nand final outputs.\n5\nData and Models\nDatasets. We evaluate our framework on two do-\nmains to test the generalizability of race encoding\nmechanisms across different contexts.\nToxiGen\n(Hartvigsen et al., 2022) is a large-scale machine-\ngenerated dataset of toxic statements about minor-\nity groups. We use the annotated subset containing\n9.9k samples across 13 target groups. Each sample\nhas a statement for a specific group (e.g., “asians\nare trying to take over the world with their karate\nskills”). From all groups, we consolidate related\ncategories into five racial categories: Asian (asian,\nchinese), Black (black), Latino (latino, mexican),\nNative American (native_american), and Middle\nEastern (middle_east, jewish, muslim).\nWe ex-\nclude non-racial categories (women, lgbtq, men-\ntal_dis, physical_dis).\nC-REACT (Contextual-\nized Race and Ethnicity Annotations for Clini-\ncal Text (Bear Don’t Walk IV et al., 2024)) pro-\nvides race and ethnicity annotations for 17,281 sen-\ntences drawn from clinical notes in the MIMIC-\nIII database. C-REACT contains real clinical text\nwhere race information appears in two forms: di-\nrect mentions that explicitly state race (e.g., “Pt\nis 42 yo AA female”) and indirect mentions that\nimply race through associated attributes such as\nspoken language or country of origin (e.g., “Pt re-\nquired a Spanish interpreter”, “Pt is recently im-\nmigrated from France”). C-REACT provides five\nracial categories: White, Black/African American\n(Black/AA), Asian, Native American or Alaska Na-\ntive, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.\nHowever, the dataset is highly imbalanced: zero\npatients labeled as Native Hawaiian or Other Pa-\ncific Islander were found, and only three patients\nlabeled as Native American or Alaska Native. We\ntherefore use three racial categories with suﬀicient\nrepresentation: White, Black/AA, and Asian.\nModels. We study three instruction-tuned LLMs\nof comparable scale from different geographic\nand cultural training contexts: Llama-3.1-8B-IT\n(Grattafiori et al., 2024) (US), Mistral-7B-IT-v0.3\n(Jiang et al., 2023) (France), and Qwen2.5-7B-IT\n(Qwen Team, 2024) (China).\nThis selection al-\nlows us to investigate whether models trained on\ndata from different linguistic and cultural contexts\nencode racial information differently, given that\nconceptions of race and ethnicity vary across so-\ncieties.\n6\nExperiments and Results\n6.1\nToxiGen\nTable 1 lists top tokens projected by each race direc-\ntion.

To investigate what drives\nthese biases, we measure activation levels for all\nneuron groups across all classification outcomes\n(Table 7). We observe a strong correspondence be-\ntween neuron groups exhibiting consistently high\nactivation and dominant error directions identified\nin Table 6. For Qwen2.5-7B, which primarily mis-\nclassifies White patients as Asian, the Asian Direct\nneurons show consistently high positive activation\nregardless of ground truth or prediction. Similarly,\nMistral-7B’s tendency toward White →Black/AA\nerrors aligns with elevated activity in Black/AA Di-\nrect neurons across most scenarios. Llama-3.1-8B\npresents a different pattern: while its dominant er-\nror is also White →Asian, Asian Indirect neurons\nshow consistently high activation across scenarios.\nThese patterns reveal that neuron groups exhibiting\nhigh activation across all conditions correspond to\ndominant misclassification directions, suggesting\nthey may play a causal role in bias.

Having identified candidate\nbias drivers, we test whether steering these neurons\ncan correct misclassification. Specifically, we eval-\nuate the intervention using three amplification fac-\ntors (5, 10, 20) to assess if these adjustments alter\nthe model’s predictions. Figure 4 compares cor-\nrect prediction rates between Direct and Indirect\nneuron intervention, while Figure 5 shows the full\nprediction distribution across all conditions.\nDirect vs. Indirect Neurons.\nAcross all three\nmodels, Direct neuron intervention demonstrates\nstronger causal eﬀicacy than Indirect interven-\ntion (Figure 4).\nAt factor 5, Direct interven-\ntion achieves substantially higher correct predic-\ntion rates across all models compared to Indirect\nintervention. More importantly, Direct interven-\ntion completely eliminates original bias across all\nmodels and amplification factors (Figure 5), while\nIndirect intervention leaves residual bias. This gap\nis also consistent with Llama-3.1-8B’s pattern: al-\nthough the Asian Indirect group has higher mean\nactivation, higher activation does not necessarily\nmean stronger causal influence on final prediction.\nIndirect cues tend to reflect broad, proxy signals\nthat can be supported by multiple parts of net-\nwork, so steering one indirect group may be partly\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Classification Outcome (Actual →Predicted)\nModel\nNeuron Group\nW→W\nW→B\nW→A\nB→W\nB→B\nB→A\nA→W\nA→B\nA→A\nQwen2.5-7B\nAsian Direct\n+6.04\n+6.25\n+5.85\n+3.50\n+5.71\n—\n+4.66\n—\n+3.86\nAsian Indirect\n−1.03\n−1.02\n−0.96\n+0.31\n−0.06\n—\n−1.55\n—\n−0.33\nBlack/AA Direct\n−0.74\n−0.04\n−0.40\n+0.28\n+0.83\n—\n+0.27\n—\n+0.27\nBlack/AA Indirect\n−0.57\n+0.40\n−0.63\n+5.80\n+3.30\n—\n−0.39\n—\n−0.78\nWhite Direct\n−3.25\n−3.49\n−3.80\n−2.06\n−3.05\n—\n−4.87\n—\n−4.01\nWhite Indirect\n+0.36\n+0.31\n−0.20\n−0.90\n−1.24\n—\n−0.33\n—\n−1.31\nMistral-7B\nAsian Direct\n+0.22\n+0.24\n+0.14\n—\n−0.15\n—\n+0.36\n—\n+0.19\nBlack/AA Direct\n+0.82\n+0.89\n+0.64\n—\n−0.07\n—\n+1.00\n—\n+0.41\nBlack/AA Indirect\n−0.56\n−0.42\n−0.55\n—\n+0.19\n—\n−0.52\n—\n−0.44\nWhite Direct\n+0.10\n−0.06\n−0.02\n—\n−0.47\n—\n+0.33\n—\n+0.37\nWhite Indirect\n−0.01\n+0.24\n−0.17\n—\n−0.27\n—\n−0.44\n—\n−0.32\nLlama-3.1-8B\nAsian Direct\n−0.53\n−0.59\n−0.59\n—\n−0.57\n−0.54\n−0.41\n−0.51\n−0.55\nAsian Indirect\n+0.27\n+0.28\n+0.33\n—\n+0.36\n+0.43\n+0.29\n+0.34\n+0.47\nBlack/AA Direct\n−1.07\n−1.43\n−1.20\n—\n−1.97\n−1.66\n−0.54\n−1.60\n−0.96\nBlack/AA Indirect\n−0.01\n+0.01\n−0.00\n—\n+0.04\n+0.07\n+0.03\n+0.03\n+0.03\nWhite Direct\n+0.11\n+0.37\n+0.24\n—\n+0.51\n+0.49\n+0.62\n+0.34\n+0.70\nWhite Indirect\n+0.22\n+0.28\n+0.32\n—\n+0.01\n+0.04\n−0.04\n+0.01\n−0.01\nTable 7: Mean neuron activation scores on C-REACT indirect mention prompts, grouped by classification outcome (actual →\npredicted).

By contrast, Direct neurons are\nmore directly tied to producing explicit race labels,\nwhich makes intervening on them more effective.\nAmplification Factor Selection. The choice of\namplification factor involves a tradeoff between\nbias correction and model stability. We tested fac-\ntors of 5, 10, and 20, representing increasingly ag-\ngressive intervention.\nAcross all models, factor\n5 yields the best balance. Qwen2.5-7B achieves\n100% correct predictions with no Unknown out-\nputs at factor 5, but destabilizes at factor 20 (63%\nUnknown responses). Mistral-7B reaches 75% cor-\nrect predictions at factor 5, with higher factors in-\ncreasingly shifting predictions toward Asian rather\nthan the correct White label. Llama-3.1-8B per-\nforms similarly at factors 5 and 10 (around 80%\ncorrect), with factor 20 introducing Unknown re-\nsponses. These results suggest moderate interven-\ntion strength suﬀices to alter predictions via race-\nencoding neurons; we adopt factor 5 as the default.\n7\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nOur results indicate that the way race and ethnicity\nare internally represented in LLMs is central to un-\nderstanding how demographic bias emerges across\ntasks. The first important finding is that racial and\nethnic concepts are distributed across many in-\nternal units rather than localized to a small set\nof neurons. Importantly, this distribution is not\narbitrary: models decompose race and ethnicity\ninto multiple, interpretable semantic facets, such\nas explicit group labels and associated geographic\nor linguistic attributes. Across both ToxiGen and\nC-REACT, these facets appear as distinct internal\nrepresentations rather than single abstract concepts\n(Tables 1, 2, 3). Notably, stereotype-related and\nhistorically harmful associations are present across\nmodels despite differences in training data and geo-\ngraphic origin, suggesting that bias mitigation can-\nnot rely on a universal map of demographic fea-\ntures but requires model-specific localization.\nSecondly, due to this representational structure,\nthe same internal components can be reused across\ndifferent task contexts, sometimes in ways that\nlead to biased behavior. Neurons encoding racial\nconcepts are present in all three models, yet\ntheir influence on predictions varies substan-\ntially depending on whether the input associates\nstrongly with the proxy cues. The same represen-\ntations that benignly encode demographic informa-\ntion can lead to biased predictions when activated\nin contexts where race is irrelevant.\nCrucially, the presence of such representations\nis not inherently problematic. Rather, bias arises\nfrom how these representations are operational-\nized during inference.\nOur intervention did not\nerase racial knowledge from the models; instead, it\nmodulated how this knowledge was reused in task-\nspecific settings. This distinction is critical: pre-\ntrained representations reflect what models learn\nabout the world, whereas task-dependent bias re-\nflects when and how those representations are in-\nappropriately applied.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "8\nConclusion\nWe provide a mechanistic analysis of how race\nand ethnicity are represented and operationalized\nwithin LLMs.\nWe show that demographic con-\ncepts are encoded as distributed, multi-faceted in-\nternal representations that can be selectively reused\nacross tasks. These findings suggest that mitigat-\ning demographic bias in LLMs requires not only\noutcome-level interventions, but also a deeper ex-\namination of representational structure and task-\ndependent reuse.\nEthical Statement\nThis work examine how race and ethnicity are en-\ncoded with large language models, which necessar-\nily involves sensitive content including stereotypes\nand historically offensive terminology. We present\nthese findings to expose potential bias, not to am-\nplify them. We acknowledge that racial categories\nare socially constructed and vary across cultures;\nour use of categories reflects the structure of the\ndatasets rather than an endorsement of these tax-\nonomies.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Li-\nbrary of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of\nHealth, under award number R00LM014308.\nReferences\nHiba Ahsan, Arnab Sen Sharma, Silvio Amir, David\nBau, and Byron C Wallace. 2025.
