It is not a brand new topic,\nsince there have been NLP researchers trying\nto deploy NLP techniques into the biomedi-\ncal domain a long time ago, and the BioNLP\nworkshop has been held since 2002 for 23\nyears 1.\nThere is indeed growing interest\nfrom both researchers and practitioners, such\nas the recently emerged workshops includ-\ning CL4Health at LREC-COLING2024 and\nNAACL2025 (Ananiadou et al., 2025), 6th\nHealthNLP at ICHI2023 2, Big Data Analytics\nin Healthcare at IEEE-BigData2023 3, Clini-\ncalNLP4 etc. new shared tasks such as Bio-\nLaySumm (Xiao et al., 2025), PLABA (plain\nlanguage adaptation of biomedical abstract)\n(Ondov et al., 2025), etc.\nThis tutorial starts with an explanation of\neach sub-task into three layers (data resource,\nNLP, and patients), how they are defined, and\nwhat NLP approaches were used to address\nsuch tasks in history, up to the state-of-the-art\nmodels.\nFirst, in the resource layer, we talk about 1.1)\nAnnotation Guidelines: how the clinical docu-\nments shall be annotated and anonymised to\nprotect privacy and address ethical concerns.\n1.2) Ethical Approval and Data Governance:\nhow data should be hosted and how access is\ngranted for research purposes. 1.3) Synthetic\n1https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/BioNLP_\nWorkshop\n2https://www.healthnlp.info/\n3https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.\nca/healthcare4bigdata4analytic/\n4https://aclanthology.org/venues/\nclinicalnlp/\narXiv:2512.08617v1  [cs.CL]  9 Dec 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Annotation\nguidelines\ndata\nEthical\napproval\nGovernance\npatients\nNER\nModel\nEval\nRE\nLinking\nPPIE\nSynthetic\ndata?\nRule/ML\nLLM+KG\nRAG\n…\nsimplify\ntranslate\nsentiment\n…\nXAI\nSDM\nLiteracy\nsummarise\n…\nFigure 1: An overview of HealthcareNLP tasks (up-down): 1) data-layer annotation guidelines, ethical\napprovals, governance, and synthetic data applications; 2) NLP-Eval-layer tasks on named entity\nrecognition, relation extractions, sentiment analysis, entity linking, and possible NLP techniques including\ntraditional rule/ML, LLMs with KG, retrieval-augmented generation, explainable AI (XAI); 3) patients-\nlayer related event: public patient involvement and engagement; text simplification / lay-language\nadaptation and summarisation for public health literacy, and machine translation for multilingual setting\n(L2 learners in a new country), shared decision making (SDM) communication support.\ndata generation (connecting to NLP): how this\ntask can be useful to address data sharing\nand scarcity issues. Second, in the NLP-eval\nlayer, these tasks include 2.1) standard named\nentity recognition (NER) in biomedical and\nclinical domains such as disease, symptoms,\ndiagnoses, treatments, and progression en-\ntity categories. 2.2) relation extraction (RE)\nsuch as drugs and side-effects, symptoms\nand treatments, treatments and temporality,\netc. 2.3) sentiment analysis of NLP models\non patient-centred text data, including patient\ninterview transcripts, online forums, and con-\nsultations.\n2.4) Clinical Coding (normalisa-\ntion/linking), which automates the traditional\nhuman coders work by linking the clinical enti-\nties into clinical knowledge graphs and dictio-\nnaries; 2.5) Machine Translation (MT): on trans-\nlating clinical text from one language to others\nto address low-resource eHealth model train-\ning obstacles as well as in a multilingual consul-\ntation environment where the patients cannot\nspeak/understand the dominant language; 2.6)\nText Simplification and Summarisation: to help\npatients better understand the clinical evalu-\nation documents and healthcare information\nwebsites. We will introduce the method ap-\nplied to these tasks from historical rule-based,\nto statistical, and nowadays neural network\nmodels with attention mechanisms. If time al-\nlows, we will cover the state-of-the-art retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG), large language\nmodels with knowledge graphs (LLM+KG), and\nprompt engineering, as shown in Figure 1 in\nthe overview of HealthcareNLP picture. Third,\nin the patient layer, we also mention some en-\ngaging events in this field, including 3.1) pub-\nlic and patient involvement and engagement\n(PPIE) practice examples from the UK and EU\nprojects, 3.2) patient health literacy, and 3.3)\nhow to better support the communication be-\ntween clinicians and patients for better shared\ndecision making (SDM).\n2\nTutorial organisers\n• Lifeng Han, Postdoc, Leiden University\nMedical Center, l.han@lumc.nl, NL, re-\nsearcher in ClinicalNLP from UK and EU\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "funded projects.\n• Paul Rayson, Professor, Lancaster Univer-\nsity, UK, p.rayson@lancaster.ac.uk, Direc-\ntor of UCREL research centre that com-\nbines research in corpus linguistics and\nNLP.\n• Suzan\nVerberne,\nProfessor\nof\nNat-\nural\nLanguage\nProcessong,\nLei-\nden\nUniversity,\nThe\nNetherlands,\ns.verberne@liacs.leidenuniv.nl,\nSuzan\nVerberne is professor of Natural Lan-\nguage Processing at the Leiden Institute\nof Advanced Computer Science (LIACS).\nShe has supervised projects involving a\nlarge number of application domains and\ncollaborations, many of which in health\nand medical contexts.\n3\nTarget Audience\nThis tutorial will be developed for NLP re-\nsearchers who are interested in applying their\nmodels and methods to the healthcare domain,\nwhich potentially can have a real impact on so-\ncial lives and healthcare systems, making them\nmore efficient and accurate.
