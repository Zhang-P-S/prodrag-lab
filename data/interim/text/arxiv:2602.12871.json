Prior work\nsuggests that LLMs can identify clinically relevant\nsignals in text and generate plausible diagnostic\nhypotheses by leveraging mental health knowledge\nacquired during pretraining (Li et al., 2024; Wang\net al., 2024; Omar and Levkovich, 2025). How-\never, psychiatric diagnosis is a high-stakes, criteria-\ndriven process, and it remains unclear whether ex-\nisting evaluations meaningfully assess how LLMs\napply diagnostic criteria under realistic conditions.\n*Equal Contribution\n†Corresponding Authors\n1https://github.com/HoyunS/MentalBench\nA central difficulty in psychiatric diagno-\nsis arises from its inherently multi-criteria and\nboundary-sensitive decision structure. Diagnostic\njudgments are governed by standardized frame-\nworks such as DSM-5, which require integrating\nsymptom combinations, duration constraints, func-\ntional impairment, exclusion rules, and distinctions\nbetween clinically similar disorders (Clark et al.,\n2017). In practice, these judgments are further com-\nplicated by incomplete or selectively reported pa-\ntient information. As a result, evaluating diagnostic\nperformance requires benchmarks that go beyond\nfactual recall of diagnostic criteria and test how\nmodels make decisions when diagnostic bound-\naries are unclear.\nDespite this need, existing mental health bench-\nmarks remain limited. Importantly, this gap reflects\nnot a lack of interest, but the inherent difficulty\nin constructing high-quality psychiatric diagnos-\ntic data. Strict privacy regulations, the absence of\nobjective biomarkers, and the complexity of for-\nmal diagnostic logic make large-scale curation of\nexpert-validated datasets exceptionally challeng-\ning (Ive, 2022; Vedanta and Rao, 2024). Conse-\nquently, most benchmarks rely on social media\ndata and self-reported labels (Yates et al., 2017; Co-\nhan et al., 2018), which are ill-suited for evaluating\nDSM-grounded diagnostic judgments or systematic\ndifferential diagnosis. To date, no benchmark has\nbeen designed to rigorously assess psychiatric diag-\nnostic decision-making in controlled yet clinically\ngrounded settings.\nIn this work, we introduce MENTALBENCH, a\nbenchmark designed to address this gap. At its core\nis MENTALKG, a psychiatrist-built and validated\nknowledge graph that explicitly encodes DSM-5\ndiagnostic criteria and differential diagnostic rules\nfor 23 psychiatric disorders. MENTALKG serves\nas a golden-standard logical backbone, constructed\nwith direct expert involvement rather than automat-\nically extracted from text. Leveraging this struc-\n1\narXiv:2602.12871v1  [cs.CL]  13 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "tured knowledge, we generate diagnostic scenarios\nthrough rule-consistent augmentation and subse-\nquently review them with psychiatrists to ensure\nclinical plausibility. This design yields synthetic\ndata with low annotation noise and enables fine-\ngrained analysis: model errors can be disentangled\ninto deficiencies in domain knowledge versus fail-\nures in applying diagnostic criteria.\nUsing MENTALKG as a foundation, MENTAL-\nBENCH comprises 24,750 synthetic clinical cases\nthat systematically vary along two clinically critical\naxes: information completeness (from structured\nmedical–chart–like descriptions to incomplete pa-\ntient self-reports) and diagnostic complexity (from\nsingle-disorder cases to challenging differential di-\nagnosis scenarios). These controlled variations al-\nlow us to evaluate not only whether a model can\nidentify relevant diagnoses, but also whether it can\nappropriately determine the number of diagnoses\nto commit to in ambiguous settings.\nOur experimental results reveal a nuanced limi-\ntation of current LLMs. While models demonstrate\nstrong performance on structured, single-answer\nqueries that directly probe DSM-5 knowledge, they\nstruggle when faced with clinically similar dis-\norders where the key challenge lies in deciding\nwhether to commit to a single diagnosis or retain\nmultiple plausible alternatives. This difficulty in\ncalibrating diagnostic commitment, rather than a\nlack of factual knowledge, emerges consistently\nacross model families and remains largely unexam-\nined by existing benchmarks. Our contributions are\nthreefold:\n• We construct MENTALKG, a psychiatrist-built\nand validated knowledge graph encoding DSM-\n5 diagnostic criteria and differential diagnostic\nrules for 23 psychiatric disorders.\n• We introduce MENTALBENCH, a clinically\ngrounded benchmark of 24,750 synthetic diag-\nnostic cases generated from expert-curated logic,\nenabling low-noise and interpretable evaluation.\n• We provide a systematic analysis showing that\ncurrent LLMs struggle not with recalling diag-\nnostic knowledge, but with calibrating diagnostic\ncommitment in the presence of clinically over-\nlapping conditions.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLMs in Mental Health Diagnosis\nRecent studies demonstrate that LLMs can identify\nclinically meaningful patterns in text and suggest\npotential diagnoses (Yang et al., 2023, 2024; Song\net al., 2025; Ozgun et al., 2025). Despite promising\nresults, the studies simultaneously revealed limi-\ntations in performing diagnostic decision-making.\nFor instance, Yang et al. (2023) found that LLMs\noften fail to identify clinical signals present in text,\nleading to inaccurate diagnoses. Similarly, Ozgun\net al. (2025) discovered systematic misclassifica-\ntion patterns among clinically similar disorders,\nwhere models frequently confuse adjustment dis-\norder with depression and bipolar disorder with\ndepression. These findings highlight the necessity\nof systematically evaluating LLMs’ psychiatric di-\nagnostic capabilities before their integration into\nreal-world clinical practice.\n2.2\nBenchmarks for Mental Health Diagnosis\nMost existing benchmarks for mental health diag-\nnosis rely on social media data (Shing et al., 2018;\nJi et al., 2022; Coppersmith et al., 2015b; Pirina and\nÇöltekin, 2018), which depend on self-reported la-\nbels and lack clinically validated ground truth. This\nreliance reflects the inherent difficulty of construct-\ning high-quality psychiatric diagnostic datasets,\ngiven strict privacy regulations, the absence of ob-\njective biomarkers, and the complexity of formal\ndiagnostic logic. Recent question-answering bench-\nmarks (Jin et al., 2023; Alhuzali et al., 2024; Racha\net al., 2025) expand beyond social media classifi-\ncation, but primarily assess factual knowledge or\ncover a limited range of disorders, failing to capture\nthe decision-making complexity of clinical diag-\nnosis. In contrast, MENTALBENCH is built upon\na psychiatrist-validated knowledge graph that ex-\nplicitly encodes DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and dif-\nferential diagnostic rules, enabling logic-grounded\nevaluation of psychiatric diagnostic capabilities.\n2.3\nQuestion Answering Benchmarks in\nMedical Domain\nIn\ngeneral\nmedicine,\nbenchmarks\nsuch\nas\nMedQA (Jin et al., 2021), MedMCQA (Pal et al.,\n2022), and PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019) are widely\nused to evaluate medical knowledge in LLMs.\nHowever, mental health–related cases form only a\nsmall subset of these datasets and do not reflect the\nunique challenges of psychiatric diagnosis, which\noften involves ambiguous symptom descriptions\nand clinically overlapping conditions. Unlike\ngeneral medical QA, psychiatric diagnosis requires\ndeciding whether to commit to a single diagnosis\nor retain multiple plausible alternatives.

The framework models the hierarchical and relational dependencies\nbetween disorders, symptom groups, and symptoms, alongside directional differential diagnoses. The resulting graph comprises\n23 Disorder nodes, 23 Symptom Group nodes, 84 Symptom nodes, and 87 Differential Diagnosis nodes. These entities are\ninterconnected via mandatory edges, included-in (hierarchical) edges, and differential diagnosis edges, forming a dense network\nof clinical dependencies.\nTALBENCH explicitly models this challenge by\nincorporating both informational uncertainty and\ndiagnostic complexity, which are not addressed by\nexisting medical benchmarks.\n3\nMENTALKG\nDue to the diagnostic complexity resulting from\noverlapping symptoms among psychiatric disor-\nders, generating clinical cases without guiding psy-\nchiatric diagnostic criteria can produce clinically\nvague cases that lack diagnostic representativeness.\nTo ensure the clinical reliability of the generated\ncases, we construct MENTALKG, a psychiatrist-\nvalidated knowledge graph that structurally for-\nmalizes DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association\net al., 2013) diagnostic criteria. Our graph decom-\nposes complex clinical diagnostic criteria into four\ndistinct entity types: Symptom, Symptom Group,\nDisorder, and Differential Diagnosis.\n3.1\nGraph Components\nSymptom Nodes.\nMENTALKG comprises 84\nsymptom nodes (S) covering the diagnostic criteria\nfor 23 mental disorders. Each symptom node con-\ntains two attributes: a textual description describing\nthe clinical meaning of the symptom, and a set of\nsubtypes representing its specific manifestations.\nSymptom Group Nodes.\nThe DSM-5 often or-\nganizes symptoms into clinically relevant groups,\nsuch as depressive and manic episodes. To rep-\nresent this hierarchy, we introduce 23 symptom\ngroup nodes (G), which aggregate related symp-\ntom nodes.\nDisorder Nodes.\nMENTALKG contains 23 dis-\norder nodes (D) corresponding to specific mental\ndisorders in DSM-5, which we select in consulta-\ntion with psychiatrists based on two criteria: (1)\nhigh clinical prevalence, (2) need for differential\ndiagnosis from other disorders. We map DSM-5 di-\nagnostic criteria for each disorder in MENTALKG\nto a structured graph representation, connecting dis-\norder nodes (D) directly to symptom group nodes\n(G) to represent the symptoms required for diagno-\nsis (details are in Figure 1). For more fine-grained\ndiagnostic requirements, such as minimum symp-\ntom thresholds and duration constraints, we encode\nthem as internal attributes of the disorder nodes.\nThrough this process, the natural language descrip-\ntions of DSM-5 are effectively transformed into\nstructurally formalized information in the graph.\nDifferential Diagnosis Nodes.\nIn clinical prac-\ntice, patients’ self-reports rarely perfectly match\nthe diagnostic criteria of a single disorder. Chal-\nlenges often arise when symptoms overlap, or clin-\nical evidence is inconclusive; for instance, a pa-\ntient presenting with depression who also exhibits\nmanic features requires careful differentiation be-\ntween Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar II\nDisorder. To address this, we introduce differential\ndiagnosis nodes (Dd) connecting a primary sus-\npicion (D1) to an alternative (D2) via a directed\nedge. This directionality captures scenarios where\na patient resembles D1, but specific confounding\ncontexts (e.g., ambiguous duration or shared symp-\ntoms) necessitate the evaluation of D2.\nEach node internally encodes the differential\ndiagnostic criteria using the following three at-\ntributes: (1) Triggering Condition, which speci-\nfies additional symptoms that prompt the need for\ndifferential diagnosis; (2) Key Difference, which\nrepresents the core points of divergence between\nthe two disorders; and (3) Discriminating Rules,\nwhich specify conditional decision rules for de-\ntermining the final diagnosis. For example, when\ndepressive episodes co-occur with elevated mood,\ndifferential diagnosis between MDD and BD be-\ncomes necessary. The key difference lies in whether\nmanic symptoms collectively satisfy the criteria for\na Manic Episode: if so, BD is diagnosed; otherwise,\nMDD.

Our pipeline consists of three\nstages: (1) Symptom Profile Construction, where concrete symptom configurations are sampled from MENTALKG; (2) Patient\nProfile Instantiation, which assigns demographic and specific symptom manifestations; and (3) Clinical Case Generation, which\nsynthesizes clinical cases based on patient profiles. These processes are applied under two clinical scenarios: Single-Disease\nIdentification and Differential Diagnosis.\n3.2\nExpert Validation\nThe entire construction process of MENTALKG\nwas conducted in collaboration with two experts.\nSpecifically, the psychiatrist validated the follow-\ning aspects of the graph: (1) the clinical appropriate-\nness of symptom subtypes within symptom nodes,\n(2) the alignment of the formalized diagnostic cri-\nteria with DSM-5 standards, and (3) the clinical\nvalidity of the differential diagnosis logic. Through\niterative cycles of expert review and refinement, kg\ncan structurally encode the complex diagnostic cri-\nteria and differential diagnostic logic of the DSM-5\nrather than simply serving as a simple collection of\ndisorder–symptom connections. A detailed valida-\ntion process is provided in Appendix A.3.\n4\nMENTALBENCH\nBuilding upon MENTALKG as a structured foun-\ndation, we generate MENTALBENCH, a question-\nanswering benchmark consisting of synthetically\ngenerated clinical cases that describe specific pa-\ntients’ psychiatric symptom profiles and their cor-\nresponding diagnostic options. Following the gen-\neration pipeline illustrated in Figure 2, we generate\nfour types of clinical cases across two diagnostic\nscenarios: (1) Single–Disease Identification (Medi-\ncal Chart, Patient Self-Report) and (2) Differential\nDiagnosis (Unambiguous, Ambiguous).\n4.1\nSingle–Disease Identification\nIn this setting, we focus on generating clinical cases\nfor single-disease identification, where each case\nrepresents a clinically typical presentation for only\na single mental disorder. The following subsections\ndetail the process of generating clinical cases for\neach type.\n4.1.1\nSymptom Profile Construction\nPatients sharing the same psychiatric diagnosis of-\nten exhibit substantial clinical heterogeneity, char-\nacterized by diverse symptom combinations and\nvarying durations. To capture this diversity in the\ngenerated clinical cases, we construct multiple\nsymptom profiles for each disorder by sampling\nsymptom configurations from MENTALKG. We\nconsider two clinical scenarios.\nType 1 – Medical Chart.\nThis type represents a\nclinical scenario in which a psychiatrist has com-\npleted a diagnostic interview with a patient and\ndocumented it in the medical chart. Under the as-\nsumption that all information necessary for diag-\nnosis has been fully collected, we sample symp-\ntom combinations that strictly satisfy all DSM-5\ndiagnostic requirements, such as meeting the mini-\nmum symptom threshold (e.g., at least five required\nsymptoms for MDD). We generate 5 seed profiles\nper disorder for this type.\nType 2 – Patient Self-Report.\nThis type reflects\na scenario in which patients directly describe their\nsubjective distress to clinicians in their own words.\nMotivated by the clinical reality that patients tend\nto focus on chief complaints while omitting sec-\nondary symptoms (Feng et al., 2021; McBride et al.,\n2018), we sample incomplete symptom profiles\nfrom MENTALKG that include core symptoms of\nthe target disorder but fall below the DSM-5 di-\nagnostic threshold (e.g., only three symptoms for\nMDD). In this type, we generate ten seed profiles\nper disorder.\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "•\nDisease: Major Depressive Disorder\n•\nSymptom: Depressed_Mood, Psychomotor_Changes, Worthlessness_Guilt, Death_Suicide\n•\nDuration: 5 Months\n•\nDemographics : 37/Male/Zookeeper/Married\nPatient Profile\nDifferential Diagnosis\n•\nTriggering Condition: Presence of Manic Symptoms\n•\nKey Difference: Meeting criteria for hypomanic episode\n•\nDiscriminating Rules:\n-\nRule A: Hypomanic symptoms may be present, but criteria for a hypomanic episode are not met.\n-\nRule B: Hypomanic symptoms are accompanied.\nAmbiguous\nㅇ\nUnambiguous-A\nUnambiguous-B\nIt's been close to five months now, this… gloom.

Ambiguous cases integrate triggering conditions into base profiles, while Unambiguous cases further apply\ndiscriminating rules to yield a definitive diagnosis.\nOption Choices.\nFor each sampled symptom pro-\nfile, we assign four diagnostic options. To evaluate\nwhether models can discriminate between clinically\nsimilar disorders with a precise understanding of\ndiagnostic criteria, distractors are selected from\nMENTALKG as disorders that share overlapping\nsymptoms with the target disorder.\n4.1.2\nPatient Profile Instantiation\nWe convert symptom profiles into concrete patient\nprofiles by assigning demographic attributes and\nspecific symptom manifestations. Demographic in-\nformation is sampled from pre-generated combina-\ntions produced using Gemini-2.5-Pro, and one pre-\ndefined subtype is selected for each symptom node.\nThis process yields five distinct patient profiles per\nsymptom profile, capturing variability in clinical\npresentation. Further details on the demographic\nsampling process are provided in Appendix B.1.\n4.1.3\nClinical Case Generation\nThe initialized patient profiles are converted into\nnatural language using two styles aligned with the\nscenario types in Section 4.1.1. Profiles in the Med-\nical Chart use a third-person perspective and clin-\nical terminology to simulate psychiatrists’ notes,\nwhereas profiles in the Patient Self-Report use a\nfirst-person perspective and colloquial language to\nreflect patients’ subjective reports. All scenarios\nare constrained to 150–200 words and instructed\nto avoid mentioning diagnostic labels. For each pa-\ntient profile, we generate three scenarios per type\nusing three LLMs—GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and\nQwen3-235B—to mitigate model-specific stylistic\nbias.\n4.2\nDifferential Diagnosis\nWe next construct differential diagnosis cases to\nevaluate models’ ability to distinguish among clini-\ncally similar disorders with overlapping symptom\nprofiles. We generate two types of cases: Ambigu-\nous, which maintain clinical plausibility for multi-\nple disorders by leveraging shared symptoms, and\nUnambiguous cases, which incorporate explicit dis-\ncriminative cues that resolve the case to a single\ndiagnosis.\n4.2.1\nSymptom Profile Construction\nWe construct symptom profiles by injecting differ-\nential diagnosis logic defined in MENTALKG into\nthe predefined symptom profiles from Section 4.1.1.\nThis design choice is motivated by the fact that\nsymptom profiles fully satisfying diagnostic crite-\nria for a specific disorder typically do not require\ndifferential diagnosis, whereas partially satisfied\nprofiles leave room for multiple potential diagnoses\nthat can be shifted by subtle clinical nuances. We\ndefine two differential diagnosis scenarios:\nType 3 – Ambiguous.\nThese cases represent diag-\nnostically ambiguous situations in which more than\none disorder remains clinically plausible. We con-\nstruct these cases by injecting the Triggering Con-\ndition from the target differential diagnosis node,\nwhich introduces additional symptoms that allow\nmultiple candidate diagnoses to remain plausible.\nType 4 – Unambiguous.\nThese cases represent\ndiagnostic scenarios in which multiple disorders\nare initially plausible, but explicit discriminative\ncues enable the case to be resolved to a single diag-\nnosis.

Notably,\nMentaLLaMA (Yang et al., 2024) is a special-\nized model fine-tuned from Llama-2 for the men-\ntal health domain. For Types 1 and 2, models are\ninstructed to select a single answer, whereas for\nTypes 3 and 4, they are directed to choose one\nor more answers. Details of the model versions,\nprompts, and settings are in Appendix D.

Eval-\nuation results show a clear hierarchy: proprietary\nmodels generally outperform open-source models,\nand performance generally improves with model\nscale, confirming that the benchmark effectively\nmeasures fundamental diagnostic capacity.

The results show marked limitations within\nthe D003–D007 cluster (spanning ADHD and the\nSchizophrenia spectrum), where accuracy drops\nsignificantly across most models.

Notably, models struggle significantly\nto correctly identify Persistent Depressive Disorder\n(PDD), a failure likely driven by their inability to\nresolve fine-grained temporal criteria, particularly\nthe specific duration required to distinguish it from\nthe more dominant MDD class.\nEven more critical confusion emerges in the\npsychotic cluster (top), where boundaries between\nSchizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, and Bipo-\nlar I with Psychotic Features are blurred. Unlike de-\npressive disorders, this group has been underrepre-\nsented in prior computational studies—specifically,\nSchizoaffective Disorder has rarely been evaluated\nin existing benchmarks. The high level of mutual\nconfusion observed here suggests that current mod-\nels lack the ability to differentiate these conditions\nbased on fine-grained differential criteria (e.g., the\nconcurrence of mood episodes with psychosis), un-\nderscoring an urgent need for future work to ad-\ndress these complex diagnoses.\n5.4\nError Patterns Analysis\nModels Struggle to Calibrate Diagnostic Com-\nmitment.\nTo investigate the reasoning failures\ndriving the performance divergence observed in\nTable 1, we conduct a fine-grained error analysis\non Type 3 (Ambiguous) and Type 4 (Unambiguous)\nscenarios.

Open-source mod-\nels exhibit excessive commitment in Type 4, lead-\ning to widespread Over-diagnosis because they\nfail to apply exclusionary rules. Conversely, pro-\nprietary models appear rigidly calibrated toward\ndecisiveness in Type 3, resulting in frequent Under-\ndiagnosis (insufficient commitment) by forcing\nsingle-label predictions even when clinical evi-\ndence supports multiple conditions. This diver-\ngence highlights that current models lack the adap-\ntive reasoning required to achieve this calibration,\nresulting in oscillation between excessive inclusiv-\nity and rigid strictness depending on the model\narchitecture. Analysis using other metrics is also\npresented in Appendix C.1.\nModels Lack Intrinsic Constraint Awareness.\nMotivated by these calibration failures, we investi-\ngate the impact of prompt constraints to determine\nwhether the performance gap stems from a lack of\nclinical knowledge or an inability to infer decision\nboundaries. Specifically, we compare performance\nin the Type 4 setting across three instruction lev-\nels, where the prompt explicitly directs the model\nto ‘choose all applicable diagnoses’ (Multiple),\n‘choose one or more answers’ (Hybrid), or ‘choose\nonly one answer’ (Single)2.\nFigure 7 presents the performance results for\neach prompting strategy. All models perform ro-\nbustly under the Single-answer constraint but strug-\ngle significantly in the Multiple- and Hybrid-\nanswer settings. These results indicate that while\nmodels possess the correct latent clinical knowl-\n2The prompts are listed in Appendix D.3.\nedge (evidenced by high accuracy when the search\nspace is restricted), they lack the intrinsic aware-\nness to infer diagnostic cardinality from clinical\nevidence alone. Without an explicit external con-\nstraint, models fail to self-regulate, struggling to\ndistinguish between a primary diagnosis and po-\ntential distractors. Notably, although the specific\nfailure patterns in the Hybrid setting vary by model\n(tending toward either over- or under-diagnosis), a\nconsistent trend emerges: performance improves\nsignificantly across models when they are explicitly\ninformed that there is only one correct answer. This\nreliance on explicit instructions exposes a critical\nlimitation: current models cannot autonomously\ncalibrate their prediction cardinality, a fundamen-\ntal requirement for real-world diagnosis where the\nnumber of conditions is never pre-defined.\n6\nConclusion\nWe introduce MENTALBENCH, a benchmark\ngrounded in MENTALKG for rigorously evaluating\npsychiatric diagnostic reasoning. While our exper-\niments confirm that LLMs possess robust latent\nknowledge of DSM-5 criteria, they exhibit critical\ndiagnostic failures when applied to clinical scenar-\nios. We find that models struggle to handle informa-\ntion incompleteness, with performance collapsing\nwhen shifting from structured charts to subjective\npatient narratives. Furthermore, models fail to cali-\nbrate diagnostic commitment, oscillating between\nexcessive inclusivity and rigid strictness, and lack\nthe intrinsic constraint awareness to define deci-\nsion boundaries without explicit prompting. These\nfindings confirm that MENTALBENCH poses a sub-\nstantial diagnostic challenge to current state-of-the-\nart models. By establishing a rigorous evaluation\nframework, MENTALBENCH advocates for future\nresearch to prioritize the adaptive, robust decision-\nmaking essential for real-world psychiatry.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Limitations\nDespite its contributions, this study has several\nlimitations. First, the clinical cases in MENTAL-\nBENCH are constructed as descriptive narratives\nrather than interactive dialogues. While real psychi-\natric diagnosis involves iterative clinician–patient\nconversations, our benchmark is intentionally de-\nsigned to evaluate models’ ability to apply clini-\ncally grounded diagnostic criteria under controlled\nand interpretable scenarios. Future work will lever-\nage the constructed knowledge graph to simulate\ndoctor–patient interactions and assess additional\ndiagnostic capabilities such as follow-up question\nselection.\nSecond, all clinical cases are generated exclu-\nsively in English, limiting generalizability across\nlanguages and cultural contexts where psychiatric\nsymptoms may be expressed differently. However,\nthe knowledge graph encodes DSM-5–based di-\nagnostic logic in a language-independent manner,\nmaking its structure applicable across diverse lin-\nguistic and cultural settings. This allows future\nextensions to multilingual and culturally diverse\nbenchmarks through prompt-level control.\nFinally, our evaluation focuses on models’ fi-\nnal diagnostic outputs and observable error pat-\nterns, without directly examining whether their\ninternal reasoning aligns with DSM-5 diagnostic\ncriteria. While this design enables systematic anal-\nysis of how models apply diagnostic knowledge\nat the output level, it does not capture whether\ntheir intermediate reasoning processes follow clin-\nically grounded diagnostic logic. In future work,\nwe plan to augment MENTALBENCH with explicit,\ncriterion-level diagnostic reasoning, allowing the\nbenchmark to more directly assess models’ diag-\nnostic reasoning behaviors.\nEthical Considerations\nMENTALBENCH includes only clinically grounded\nsynthesized clinical cases and does not contain any\nreal patient data, medical records, or personally\nidentifiable information. While some synthesized\ncases may describe severe psychiatric symptoms,\nincluding suicidal ideation or self-harm, such con-\ntent is presented as clinically descriptive accounts\nof symptoms that focus on patients’ reported ex-\nperiences, without including explicit descriptions\nof suicidal methods or self-harm behaviors. Ad-\nditionally, although MENTALBENCH is designed\nto reflect a wide range of clinically realistic diag-\nnostic scenarios, the benchmark does not capture\nthe full complexity of real-world clinical practice,\nas discussed in the limitations. Consequently, the\nevaluation results do not guarantee real-world clin-\nical performance and must be utilized under expert\nguidance.\nAcknowledgements\nWe used AI assistants, including ChatGPT3, Gem-\nini4 and Grammarly5, to support the writing and\ncoding processes.\nReferences\nHassan Alhuzali, Ashwag Alasmari, and Hamad Al-\nsaleh. 2024.

As illus-\ntrated, prior research has predominantly concen-\ntrated on high-prevalence conditions, specifically\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized\nAnxiety Disorder (GAD), and PTSD. While these\nconditions are critical, this narrow focus leaves a\nsignificant portion of the DSM-5 diagnostic spec-\ntrum unexplored in the context of LLM evaluation.\nNotably, complex psychopathological profiles\nand distinct subtypes remain largely underrepre-\nsented. For instance, distinctions within Schizoaf-\nfective Disorders (Bipolar vs. Depressive types)\nand specific subtypes of Bipolar Disorder (I vs. II\nvs. with Psychotic features) are rarely explicitly\nmodeled in existing datasets. Furthermore, condi-\ntions such as Delusional Disorder, Specific Pho-\nbias, and various Feeding and Eating Disorders\n(e.g., Binge-Eating Disorder) often lack dedicated\nevaluation benchmarks.\nScope of MENTALBENCH\nTable 2 presents the\ncomplete list of 23 disorders included in our work.\nTo ensure a holistic evaluation of psychopatholog-\nical reasoning, we selected representative disor-\nders across a wide spectrum of diagnostic cate-\ngories defined in the DSM-5. Our coverage en-\ncompasses Anxiety Disorders (e.g., GAD, Spe-\ncific Phobia), Obsessive-Compulsive and Related\nDisorders (e.g., OCD, Body Dysmorphic Dis-\norder), Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders\n(e.g., PTSD, Adjustment Disorder), Mood Disor-\nders (e.g., MDD, BD I and II), the Schizophrenia\nSpectrum (e.g., Delusional Disorder, Schizophre-\nnia), Feeding and Eating Disorders (e.g., Anorexia\nNervosa, Binge-Eating Disorder), and Attention-\nDeficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\nCrucially, our selection criteria prioritize the\nreplication of authentic challenges encountered in\nreal-world clinical settings, specifically address-\ning the diagnostic ambiguities posed by symptom\noverlap and subtle phenomenological distinctions.\nSince precise differentiation among these condi-\ntions is a prerequisite for identifying the primary\nNo.\nAbbreviation\nFull Name\n1\nADHD (Combined)\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity\nDisorder (Combined Presenta-\ntion)\n2\nADHD (Inattentive)\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity\nDisorder (Predominantly Inatten-\ntive Presentation)\n3\nADHD (Hyperactive)\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity\nDisorder (Predominantly Hyper-\nactive/Impulsive Presentation)\n4\nDelusional Disorder\n5\nSchizophrenia\n6\nSchizoaffective\n(Bipolar Type)\nSchizoaffective Disorder (Bipolar\nType)\n7\nSchizoaffective (De-\npressive Type)\nSchizoaffective Disorder (Depres-\nsive Type)\n8\nBD 1\nBipolar I Disorder\n9\nBD 2\nBipolar II Disorder\n10\nBD 1 w/ Psych.\nBipolar I Disorder with Psychotic\nFeatures\n11\nGAD\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder\n12\nSpecific Phobia\n13\nMDD\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n14\nPDD\nPersistent Depressive Disorder\n15\nMDD w/ Psych.\nMajor Depressive Disorder with\nPsychotic Features\n16\nOCD\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n17\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder\n18\nPTSD\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder\n19\nAcute Stress Disorder\n20\nAD\nAdjustment Disorder\n21\nAnorexia Nervosa\n22\nBulimia Nervosa\n23\nBinge-Eating Disorder\nTable 2: List of disorders covered in MENTALBENCH\npathology and determining appropriate therapeutic\ninterventions, we deliberately included disorders\nwhere accurate diagnosis hinges on fine-grained\nclinical details.\nFor instance, we explicitly distinguish between\nthe three presentations of ADHD—Combined, Inat-\ntentive, and Hyperactive—to test the model’s abil-\nity to identify specific behavioral nuances. Further-\nmore, we address the complex comorbidities found\nat the intersection of mood and psychotic symp-\ntoms, which represent a significant diagnostic hur-\ndle. To capture this, we include Schizoaffective Dis-\norder (both Bipolar and Depressive types) along-\nside Mood Disorders with Psychotic Features (BD\nI with psychotic features and MDD with psychotic\nfeatures). While these conditions often present with\nidentical symptoms, accurate diagnosis relies on an-\nalyzing duration, symptom concurrence, and sever-\nity. By including these confounding cases, we rig-\norously test the LLM’s depth of expert-level psy-\nchiatric knowledge.\nRegarding the target demographic, our bench-\nmark focuses on adult clinical narratives. Conse-\nquently, we generally exclude neurocognitive and\nneurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s\nDisease) and conditions primarily diagnosed in\nearly childhood (e.g., Conduct Disorder).

Specifically, the experts perform a rigorous\nvalidation focusing on three key aspects:\n1) Clinical Appropriateness of Subtypes within\nSymptom Nodes\nExperts verify whether the phe-\nnotypic manifestations (Subtypes) listed under\neach symptom node accurately represented the core\nclinical concept of that node. During this process,\nsubtypes that are semantically ambiguous or ex-\nhibited significant overlap with other nodes are\nremoved or reassigned. For instance, Hopelessness\n(S083), initially categorized as a subtype of the\nDepressed Mood (S024) node, is separated into a\ndistinct symptom node to accurately implement the\nspecific diagnostic criteria for Persistent Depres-\nsive Disorder.\n2) Alignment with DSM-5 Standards\nExperts\nreview the structural connections between Symp-\ntom and Symptom Group nodes, as well as the\nlogic encoded in node attributes, to ensure they\nfaithfully reflect the formal diagnostic criteria of\nthe DSM-5. During this review, experts manually\nencoded Additional Requirements (e.g., exclusion\ncriteria) into disorder nodes to sharpen the decision\nboundaries between clinically similar conditions if\nneeded.\n3) Clinical Validity of Differential Diagnosis\nLogic\nSince DSM-5 differential diagnosis guide-\nlines are originally presented as unstructured text,\nwe converted them into structured logical rules.\nExperts evaluate the discriminating rules within\ndifferential diagnosis nodes to ensure they appro-\npriately capture real-world patterns of diagnostic\nconfusion and the discrimination logic between\npaired disorders. Through this iterative review, am-\nbiguous rules are refined or discarded, and specific\nconditional contexts are added to establish clearer\ndiscrimination criteria.\nThis rigorous validation process ensures that\nMENTALKG successfully transforms the complex\ndiagnostic systems and differential diagnoses of\nthe DSM-5 across 23 disorders into a structured\nformat with a high level of clinical fidelity.\nB\nDetails for Benchmark\nB.1\nDemographic Sampling\nWe transform the previously constructed symptom\nprofiles into concrete patient profiles by assigning\ndemographic information. Specifically, we consider\nfour demographic attributes: age, gender, occupa-\ntion, and marital status. To generate natural and re-\nalistic demographic combinations, we use Gemini-\n2.5-Flash to produce 100 plausible combinations\nof these four attributes. Examples of the generated\ndemographic combinations are shown below.\n16\n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "• {\"Age\": 59, \"Gender\": \"Male\", \"Occupation\":\n\"Farmer\", \"Marital Status\": \"Married\"},\n• {\"Age\": 26, \"Gender\": \"Female\", \"Occupa-\ntion\": \"Emergency Room Nurse\", \"Marital\nStatus\": \"Single\"}.\nFor each symptom profile, we randomly sample\none of the pre-generated demographic combina-\ntions and assign it to the profile. This procedure\nenables the construction of diverse clinical scenar-\nios grounded in realistic patient demographics.\nB.2\nExpert Validation\nExpert\nProfessional Background\nExpert 1\nBoard-certified psychiatrist with extensive clin-\nical experience.

The evaluation is\nconduct using a 5-point Likert scale (1=Very Poor\nto 5=Excellent) across three key dimensions: (1)\nLinguistic Naturalness, assessing whether the text\nflows naturally like a human patient; (2) Diagnostic\nValidity, verifying if the clinical logic and symp-\ntom presentation align with DSM-5 criteria; and (3)\nClinical Realism, evaluating whether the scenario\nreflects the complexity and nuance of real-world\nclinical encounters.\nType\nSymptom Profile\nPatient Profile\nClinical Case\nMedical Chart\n115\n575\n1,725\nSelf-Report\n230\n1,150\n3,450\nAmbiguous\n435\n2,175\n6,525\nUnambiguous\n435\n4,350\n13,050\nTotal\n1,215\n8,250\n24,750\nTable 7: Statistics of the generated data samples\nTable 6 summarizes the results. The generated\nscenarios receive consistently high ratings from\nboth experts, with mean scores exceeding 4.3\nacross all dimensions. Notably, Linguistic Natural-\nness achieves near-perfect scores (4.94 and 4.97),\nand Clinical Realism is rated highly (4.84 and\n4.94), demonstrating that our LLM-based gener-\nation pipeline successfully captures the subtleties\nof patient narratives.\nInter-Annotator Agreement Analysis\nTo assess\nthe reliability of the expert ratings, we report Per-\ncent Agreement, Cohen’s κw (quadratic weighted;\nCohen (1968)), and Gwet’s AC2 (Gwet, 2008). As\nshown in the table, we observe a discrepancy where\nhigh Percent Agreement (e.g., 93.2% for Linguis-\ntic Naturalness) is accompanied by low κw values\n(e.g., 0.041). This is well known as the prevalence\nparadox or kappa paradox (Feinstein and Cicchetti,\n1990), where chance-corrected agreement is arti-\nficially underestimated when rating distributions\nare highly skewed. Cohen’s κ penalizes agreement\nwhen the marginal distribution of ratings is highly\nskewed. However, in our case, the overwhelming\nprevalence of high scores (4s and 5s) inflates the\nprobability of chance agreement (Pe), mathemati-\ncally suppressing the κ value despite strong actual\nconsensus between annotators.\nTo address this limitation, we adopt Gwet’s AC2\nas our primary reliability metric, as it is robust to\nprevalence effects while maintaining chance cor-\nrection (Gwet, 2008). The AC2 scores indicate sub-\nstantial reliability (ranging from 0.499 to 0.691),\nsupporting the conclusion that the high ratings re-\nflect genuine consensus on the dataset’s high qual-\nity rather than random chance.\nC\nSupplementary Discussions\nC.1\nIn-depth Error Analysis for Types 3 and 4\nThis section provides a detailed analysis comple-\nmenting Figure 6.

Open-source mod-\nels achieve higher recall in the Type 3 setting (≈\n0.79–0.81), whereas closed-source models exhibit\nsubstantially lower recall (≈0.58–0.69). At the\nsame time, closed models maintain very high pre-\ncision (≈0.94–0.96), indicating that their predic-\ntions are typically a strict subset of the correct an-\nswers and reflect a highly conservative selection\nstrategy.

Open models, in contrast, trade preci-\nsion (≈0.82–0.87) for coverage, leading to fewer\nmissed diagnoses but more frequent inclusion of\nirrelevant candidates.\nType 4 (Unambiguous)\nIn the Type 4 setting,\nwhere exactly one diagnosis is correct, both open\nand closed models maintain consistently high re-\ncall (≈0.93–0.96), suggesting that the correct di-\nagnosis is almost always included in the response.\nHowever, precision diverges sharply: open models\nshow low precision (≈0.50–0.57), while closed\nmodels achieve higher but still imperfect precision\n(≈0.71–0.82). Given the uniformly high recall, this\nprecision gap implies that models frequently select\nadditional, unnecessary diagnoses even when the\ntask is unambiguous, resulting in systematic over-\ndiagnosis. This pattern aligns with Figure 6, where\noverdiagnosis errors dominate the error distribution\nin Type 4 tasks, confirming that the primary failure\nlies in regulating prediction cardinality rather than\nidentifying the correct diagnosis.\nOverall, these findings reveal a calibration fail-\nure in diagnostic strictness. The persistent pattern\nof high recall but low precision shows that mod-\nels favor inclusive prediction strategies that ensure\nthe correct diagnosis is selected, yet fail to reliably\nexclude clinically similar distractors. This imbal-\nance reflects an inability to internally regulate the\ntrade-off between inclusivity and exclusion, lead-\ning to systematic over-diagnosis in unambiguous\ncases and under-diagnosis in ambiguous ones. As\na result, current LLMs struggle to infer appropriate\ndiagnostic cardinality from evidence alone, limit-\ning their reliability in real-world clinical settings.\nC.2\nLLM Data Generation Bias Analysis\n(Analysis of Self-Recognition Bias)\nThe dataset constructed in this study consists of\naugmented data generated partitions using the GPT,\nGemini, and Qwen model families.
