Our quantitative findings are supported\nby qualitative expert evaluation, which further\nhighlights the nuances of runtime supervision.\nTogether, our results reveal that such paired-\nagent approach can provide clinically grounded\nauditing and refinement for AI-assisted conver-\nsational mental health support.\n1\nIntroduction\nIndividuals are increasingly turning to large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) and other general-purpose\nAI systems for mental health support, using them\nto seek advice, emotional validation, and coping\nstrategies in moments of distress (Sharma et al.,\n2024). Prior work suggests that users may disclose\nhighly sensitive mental health concerns to AI sys-\ntems, particularly in contexts where human support\nis unavailable, inaccessible, or stigmatized (Shi\net al., 2025). This growing reliance on AI-mediated\nsupport places substantial demands on the quality,\nsafety, and clinical alignment of AI responses.\nAt the same time, supportive conversations in\nmental health contexts require a delicate balance of\nempathy, validation, collaboration, and risk-aware\ncommunication. Recent studies show that LLMs of-\nten generate responses that are inconsistent, overly\ndirective, or clinically unsafe—especially in high-\nrisk scenarios involving acute distress or suicidal-\nity (De Choudhury et al., 2023; Moore et al., 2025;\nKang and Reynolds, 2024). Despite their impres-\nsive linguistic fluency, LLMs lack grounding in\ntherapeutic principles, which can lead to bound-\nary violations, minimization of user concerns, or\nharmful guidance (Wang et al., 2025; Iftikhar et al.,\n2024; Yoo et al., 2025). This highlights a critical\ngap between the increasing use of general-purpose\nLLMs for mental health support and the lack of sys-\ntematic, clinically grounded mechanisms to audit\nand refine their behavior.\nPrior research has explored aligning LLMs\nwith clinical communication norms, yet most ap-\nproaches rely on implicit learning during pretrain-\ning or fine-tuning (Zhou et al., 2023; Zheng et al.,\n2024; Chen et al., 2023; Qiu and Lan, 2025). Such\nmethods lack explicit oversight mechanisms and\nprovide no guarantees that generated responses ad-\nhere to therapeutic standards. In contrast, clinical\npractice emphasizes supervision, structured evalua-\ntion, and iterative feedback as core components of\nsafe and effective counseling (Moyers et al., 2016;\nLambert et al., 2018; McAleavey et al., 2024).\nToward integrating the above two lines of work—\nimplicit model alignment in LLMs and explicit\nsupervisory mechanisms from clinical practices—\nour study is guided by the research question: Can\nLLM-based supervision enable scalable, run-\ntime evaluation and improvement of the quality\nof LLM-generated conversational support?\nIn this paper, we propose PAIR-SAFE for au-\nditing and refining safety in AI-mediated mental\nhealth support. PAIR-SAFE consists of two agents:\na Responder agent that produces supportive re-\nsponses, and a supervisory Judge agent that as-\nsesses each response against clinician-validated\narXiv:2601.12754v1  [cs.HC]  19 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "rubrics. The Judge agent monitors key therapeu-\ntic dimensions—including empathy, validation,\nboundary adherence, and risk sensitivity—and is-\nsues structured allow or revise decisions. By opera-\ntionalizing therapeutic communication principles\nas explicit evaluative constraints, this approach en-\nables transparent, auditable, and clinically aligned\noversight of AI-generated support. Our design\nshifts from prior single-agent approaches that rely\nsolely on fine-tuning to internalize therapeutic\nnorms, instead introducing a modular supervisory\nlayer that provides runtime regulation.\nWe evaluate PAIR-SAFE using clinical guide-\nlines from the Motivational Interviewing Treat-\nment Integrity (MITI-4) framework, applied to\nsimulated conversational supportive interactions\ngrounded in an annotated MI dataset (Pérez-Rosas\net al., 2019). Using a support-seeker simulator\n(SeekerSim) to enable controlled evaluation, we\nfind that the Judge-supervised approach achieves\nsignificant improvements over baseline in terms of\nReflection-to-Question ratio (d=0.94), Relational\ninteraction (d=0.47), Seek Collaboration (d=0.81),\nand MI-adherent behaviors (d=0.60), indicating\nstronger clinical alignment and higher-quality sup-\nportive responses. These quantitative findings are\nfurther supported by qualitative expert evaluation,\nwhich highlights both the observed improvements\nand important nuances in how the PAIR-SAFE ap-\nproach shapes conversational support.\nThis work makes three contributions. First, we\nshow that LLMs can serve as runtime auditing\nagents by introducing a Judge that evaluates ther-\napeutic quality using clinically grounded rubrics.\nSecond, we show that pairing this Judge with a\ngeneral-purpose LLM improves clinical alignment\nand reduces harms relative to a single-agent base-\nline. Third, we release simulated counseling con-\nversations and evaluation artifacts to support bench-\nmarking and future studies of safety in AI-mediated\nmental health support. Together, this paired-agent\ndesign enables a modular and scalable approach to\nsafer AI-assisted mental health support.\n2\nRelated Work\nMental Health and Online Support. Mental health\nresearch has long emphasized that effective support\ndepends on relational qualities such as empathy, re-\nflective listening, collaboration, and respect for au-\ntonomy. These principles are formalized in Motiva-\ntional Interviewing (MI), an evidence-based frame-\nwork widely used in counseling settings to support\nengagement and change without coercion (Miller,\n1983; Bischof et al., 2021). The Motivational In-\nterviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework\nfurther operationalizes these principles into clini-\ncally validated, observable dimensions for evaluat-\ning conversational quality (Moyers et al., 2016).\nAs support-seeking increasingly occurs in digi-\ntal environments, prior work has examined how\nthese interactional dynamics manifest in online\npeer-support communities and counseling-like fo-\nrums (De Choudhury and De, 2014; Wadden et al.,\n2021; Vornholt and De Choudhury, 2021; Kim\net al., 2023). Complementary computational stud-\nies show that linguistic markers in online dis-\ncourse reflect emotional states, responsiveness,\nand community-level support dynamics (Althoff\net al., 2016; Chancellor and De Choudhury, 2020;\nDe Choudhury et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019; Saha\nand Sharma, 2020). Together, this literature high-\nlights both the scalability of language-mediated\nsupport and the need for clinically grounded stan-\ndards to assess its quality.\nOur work builds on this foundation by using\nMITI not as a training signal but as an explicit\nevaluative lens for AI-generated support, enabling\nsystematic auditing of whether AI-mediated con-\nversations adhere to evidence-based principles of\nsupportive communication.\nAI for Mental Health Support. We see growing\ninterest in AI-based tools for mental health support,\nincluding conversational agents that provide psy-\nchoeducation, emotional support, and coping strate-\ngies through natural language interaction (Fitz-\npatrick et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2024; Das Swain\net al., 2025; Saha et al., 2025). Prior research sug-\ngests that individuals may disclose sensitive men-\ntal health concerns to AI systems, particularly in\ncontexts where human support is unavailable or\nstigmatized (Shi et al., 2025; Croes et al., 2024).\nThese systems offer advantages such as scalability,\nimmediacy, and low-cost access, making them ap-\npealing as adjuncts or entry points to mental health\nsupport (Miner et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2020; Lai\net al., 2023; Sharma et al., 2024).\nIn parallel, substantial risks have been identi-\nfied in such interactions. AI-generated responses\nmay be superficially empathetic yet therapeutically\nmisaligned, overly directive, or insufficiently re-\nsponsive to high-risk disclosures (Yoo et al., 2025;\nKang and Reynolds, 2024; Chandra et al., 2025;\nMoore et al., 2025). Prior approaches to mitigat-\ning such risks have largely focused on aligning\na single response-generation model through fine-\ntuning, reinforcement learning, or prompt-level\nconstraints (Sharma et al., 2020, 2021; Lai et al.,\n2023). While effective in some settings, these meth-\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "ods often provide limited transparency into how\ntherapeutic principles are enforced, making it chal-\nlenging to audit or correct failures at runtime.\nThis paper proposes a paired-agent approach that\ncomplements the above line of work by introducing\nexplicit, runtime supervision grounded in clinically\nvalidated criteria. Methodologically, it draws inspi-\nration from recent NLP research that uses LLMs\nas moderators (Kolla et al., 2024; Kumar et al.,\n2024; Zhan et al., 2025; Goyal et al., 2025), and\nevaluators of generated text (Huang et al., 2025;\nLi et al., 2025; Pan et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024;\nLiu et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Chiang and\nLee, 2023). We extend this line of work to sensitive\nmental health contexts by grounding LLM-based\nsupervision in established clinical rubrics, enabling\nstructured auditing and targeted refinement of AI\nconversational support.\n3\nData and Methods\n3.1\nCollecting Labeled Counseling Data\nWe source our dataset from the HighLowQuality\nConversations dataset (Pérez-Rosas et al., 2019),\nwhich consists of Motivational Interviewing (MI)\ncounseling session transcripts annotated for overall\ncounseling quality. The dataset contains human–\nhuman counseling conversations drawn from pub-\nlicly available counseling demonstrations and role-\nplay sessions, focusing exclusively on MI-based\nbehavioral counseling scenarios such as smoking\ncessation, alcohol use, and lifestyle change. Each\nconversation involves a single counselor and a sin-\ngle client and spans several minutes of dialog, cap-\nturing multi-turn interaction patterns. Here, coun-\nseling quality is annotated at the session level us-\ning guidelines from the MI literature. The anno-\ntations were produced through manual inspection\nby trained annotators and are further supported\nby fine-grained behavioral coding using the Moti-\nvational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI)\nframework (Moyers et al., 2016). High-quality con-\nversations are characterized by client-centered be-\nhaviors such as reflective listening, empathy, col-\nlaboration, and support for client autonomy, while\nlow-quality conversations exhibit directive, con-\nfrontational, or advice-giving styles with limited\nresponsiveness to client concerns. The dataset in-\ncludes 259 counseling sessions, with 155 labeled\nas high-quality and 104 labeled as low-quality.\n3.2\nMethodological Design of PAIR-SAFE\nAt a high level (Figure 1), PAIR-SAFE integrates a\nResponder and a Judge that jointly operate. Given\nthe ethical risks of engaging real patients in di-\nrect interactions with LLMs in sensitive mental\nhealth contexts, and the lack of real patient–AI\ninteractions suitable for controlled experimenta-\ntion, we simulate counseling conversations by de-\nveloping a patient/seeker simulator (SeekerSim).\nThis section elaborates how we develop SeekerSim\n(Section 3.3), build PAIR-SAFE framework (Sec-\ntion 3.4), and generate and evaluate PAIR-SAFE-\nbased conversational support (Section 3.5).\n3.3\nBuilding a Seeker Simulator: SeekerSim\nTo generate realistic and diverse help-seeker be-\nhavior, we build a seeker simulator (SeekerSim)\nthat models the linguistic, emotional, and narrative\npatterns found in human–human counseling conver-\nsations. SeekerSim synthesizes help-seeker utter-\nances using signals extracted from real-world tran-\nscripts, enabling controlled and ethically grounded\nsimulation of support-seeking interactions.\nExtracting Key Themes. To capture clinically rel-\nevant aspects of a seeker’s internal state, we draw\non counseling research (Gross, 1998; McAdams,\n2001; Beck, 2011) to define four dimensions: (1)\ncore emotions (e.g., guilt, fear, anger, emotional\nnumbness), (2) recurrent narratives that organize\nlived experience, (3) key beliefs about the self, the\nproblem, or change, and (4) symptom patterns on\npsychological or behavioral indicators (e.g., sleep\ndisturbance, impulsivity). We provide the full coun-\nseling transcript to GPT-5-nano, which extracts\nthese dimensions into a structured JSON. Identified\nthemes serve as semantic blueprints for SeekerSim,\nguiding downstream conversation simulation while\npreserving individual-specific context.\nValidation of SeekerSim. We validate SeekerSim\nby assessing whether simulated help-seeker re-\nsponses preserve both the semantic content and\nlinguistic style of the original client utterances.\nSpecifically, we compare simulated responses with\nground-truth continuations from the HighLowQual-\nity dataset using two complementary metrics—\nsemantic similarity and linguistic style similar-\nity—which prior work has shown to capture co-\nherence and stylistic alignment in mental health\nsupport conversations (Saha and Sharma, 2020).\nSemantic similarity is computed via cosine simi-\nlarity between sentence-level embeddings using\na pretrained BERT-based sentence transformer\nmodel (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), and linguis-\ntic style similarity is measured using cosine simi-\nlarity of function-word distributions derived from\nthe LIWC lexicon (Pennebaker et al., 2003).\nWe compute these metrics for: 1) matched pairs,\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "SeekerSim\nGenerate seeker's response\nFirst one-third of the original HighLowQuality transcript\nTarget Behavior\nPAIR-SAFE\nGenerate supportive response\nPAIR-SAFE Framework\nALLOW : Use the Candidate Response for this turn\nREVISE: Provide Feedback to Responder\nRegenerated\nResponse\nResponder\nJudge\nMITI Evaluation\nResults\nConversation History\nExtracted Key Themes \nCandidate\nResponse\nFigure 1: A schematic overview of our study design with the PAIR-SAFE framework (detailed on the right).\nwhere simulated responses are compared against\ntheir corresponding ground-truth continuations,\nand 2) randomly mismatched pairs, where original\nresponses are paired with simulations generated\nfor different individuals. This random-pair baseline\ncontrols for superficial similarities and allows us to\nassess whether higher similarity arises specifically\nfrom individual-level alignment.\nTable A1 compares matched and randomly mis-\nmatched pairs. We find that the matched pairs show\nhigher semantic similarity (by 59%, d=1.67) and\nlinguistic style similarity (by 0.71%, d=0.38), with\nstatistical significance. These results indicate that\nSeekerSim preserves individual-specific content\nand tone beyond chance, supporting its validity as\na controlled simulator for conversational support.\n3.4\nA Paired-Agent Framework: PAIR-SAFE\nFigure 1 shows the overall PAIR-SAFE frame-\nwork, which consists of two interacting agents: a\nResponder, for generating supportive responses,\nand a Judge which audits each response against\nclinically grounded criteria before delivery.\n3.4.1\nBuilding a Responder\nA Responder agent is responsible for generating\nsupportive, non-diagnostic responses. We use the\nGPT-4o-mini model as the back-end, and to guide\nits behavior, we provide the Responder with a set\nof principles derived from Motivational Interview-\ning (MI), emphasizing empathy, autonomy support,\nreflective listening, and non-directiveness (Moyers\net al., 2016). These principles serve as lightweight\nbehavioral constraints that shape the Responder’s\noutputs without task-specific fine-tuning, allowing\nus to examine how external supervision via the\nJudge influences response quality.\n3.4.2\nBuilding a Judge\nThe Judge agent serves as the supervisory compo-\nnent in PAIR-SAFE to evaluate the safety and thera-\npeutic quality of each Responder’s response.Given\na candidate response and conversational context,\nthe Judge assesses whether the response adheres\nto clinically grounded communication principles,\nincluding empathy, validation, and boundary main-\ntenance. Based on this evaluation, the Judge issues\none of two decisions: ALLOW or REVISE. If the\nresponse meets acceptable quality standards, an\nALLOW decision is issued, and the response is deliv-\nered unchanged; otherwise, a REVISE decision is\nissued, and the Judge provides structured feedback\nthat guides the Responder to revise and regenerate\nan improved response. Through this iterative super-\nvision mechanism, the Judge enables runtime over-\nsight and systematic refinement of AI-generated\nmental health support.\nMITI-Based Audit. We adopted a rubric-based\nevaluation within the Judge grounded in the Moti-\nvational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4),\nwhich decomposes counseling quality into multiple\ncomponents (Moyers et al., 2016). MITI-4 includes\na set of behavior frequency counts that quantify\nthe occurrence of canonical motivational interview-\ning behaviors, such as giving information, com-\nplex reflections, affirmations, and questions. These\ncounts capture observable interactional behaviors\nacross the entire conversation and provide a fine-\ngrained account of how different counseling behav-\niors are distributed over time. While the behavior\ncounts themselves do not have absolute optimal\ntargets, MI theory provides directional guidance:\nautonomy-supportive behaviors such as reflections,\naffirmations, emphasizing autonomy, and seeking\ncollaboration are generally encouraged, whereas di-\nrective behaviors such as persuasion, confrontation,\nand excessive questioning are discouraged due to\ntheir potential to elicit resistance or undermine the\nseeker’s autonomy (Moyers et al., 2016).\nSecond, MITI-4 specifies a set of global ratings\nthat assess higher-level relational qualities of the\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Metric\nHigh Low Cohen’s d\nt-test\nDerived MITI Metrics\nReflection-to-Question Ratio (R:Q)\n0.88 0.37\n0.43\n3.68***\nRelational\n3.65 2.09\n2.10\n16.27***\nTechnical\n3.24 1.89\n2.05\n15.63***\nPercent of Complex Reflections\n0.54 0.21\n1.08\n8.20***\nMI-Adherent Behaviors (MIA)\n7.72 2.78\n1.43\n11.96***\nMI-Non-Adherent Behaviors (MINA)\n1.07 3.86\n-1.27 -8.924***\nPrimary MITI Signals — Global Ratings\nCultivating Change\n3.08 1.95\n1.63\n12.96***\nSoftening Sustain\n3.40 1.83\n1.91\n14.51***\nPartnership\n3.69 2.11\n2.00\n15.36***\nEmpathy\n3.62 2.07\n1.84\n14.40***\nPrimary MITI Signals — Behavior Counts\nGiving Information\n4.16 4.85\n-0.14\n-1.18\nSimple Reflection\n2.68 1.07\n0.74\n6.11***\nComplex Reflection\n4.04 0.61\n1.14\n10.58***\nAffirm\n1.86 0.68\n0.92\n7.68***\nEmphasize Autonomy\n2.58 0.88\n1.24\n10.22***\nSeek Collaboration\n3.28 1.22\n1.34\n11.27***\nPersuade\n0.99 3.03\n-1.08\n-7.79***\nPersuade /w Permission\n0.64 0.19\n0.55\n4.85***\nConfront\n0.08 0.83\n-0.84\n-5.59***\nQuestion\n11.07 6.86\n0.57\n4.49***\nTable 1: Validation of the MITI-based Judge: Mean\nscores for high and low quality conversations, with Co-\nhen’s d and t-tests (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001).\ninteraction, including cultivating change talk, soft-\nening sustain talk, partnership, and empathy. These\nare rated on a fixed scale and are interpreted as bet-\nter when higher, as they reflect stronger relational\nalignment, collaboration, and empathic stance.\nWe refer to the behavior counts and global rat-\nings collectively as Primary MITI Signals. Based\non these signals, MITI defines a set of compos-\nite measures, referred to as Derived MITI Metrics,\nwhich combine behavior counts and global ratings\nthrough established formulas to yield summary in-\ndicators of MI proficiency, including Reflection-to-\nQuestion Ratio (R:Q), Percent of Complex Reflec-\ntions, Total MI-Adherent Behaviors (MIA), and To-\ntal MI-Non-Adherent Behaviors (MINA). For these\nderived metrics, higher values typically indicate\nstronger MI alignment, with the exception of met-\nrics that explicitly capture MI-nonadherent behav-\niors (e.g., MINA), where lower values are preferred.\nBy structuring the Judge’s evaluation around these\nlayered signals and derived metrics, our approach\nenables a clinically meaningful assessment that in-\ntegrates both surface-level interactional behaviors\nand deeper autonomy-supportive qualities central\nto effective motivational interviewing.\nValidation of Judge. To assess the construct valid-\nity of the Judge agent, we applied it to the anno-\ntated HighLowQuality dataset. For each rubric di-\nmension, we computed the average scores for high-\nquality and low-quality conversations and com-\npared them using Cohen’s d and two-sample t-tests.\nAs shown in Table 1, the differences between high\nand low quality conversations are large and statisti-\ncally significant across most metrics, demonstrat-\ning that Judge robustly distinguishes high-quality\ncounseling from low-quality counseling. Impor-\ntantly, high-quality conversations consistently re-\nceive higher scores on metrics where higher values\nreflect stronger MI alignment, such as relational\nand autonomy-supportive dimensions, while receiv-\ning lower scores on metrics where lower values\nare desirable, including MI-nonadherent indicators\nsuch as MINA, Persuade, and Confront. This pat-\ntern mirrors established MI theory and provides\nfurther evidence that the Judge captures clinically\nmeaningful distinctions, supporting its use as a su-\npervisory auditing signal within our framework.\n3.4.3\nPairing Responder & Judge Agents\nIn the PAIR-SAFE framework, we operational-\nize a paired-agent supervision by integrating the\nResponder and Judge within a single conversa-\ntional loop. At each turn of receiving an input from\na user (or SeekerSim in our case), the Responder\ngenerates a candidate supportive response condi-\ntioned on the evolving dialogue. This candidate\nresponse is then evaluated by the Judge using clin-\nically grounded criteria (MITI-4). As mentioned\nabove, the Judge issues either ALLOW or REVISE.\nTo empirically ground the Judge’s decisions, we\nderive reference values from the HighLowQuality\ndataset. We define the reference threshold as the\nmidpoint between the mean MITI-4 scores of high-\nand low-quality conversations.\nAccordingly,\nduring\nevaluation,\nif\nthe\nResponder’s\ncandidate\nresponse\nmeets\nthe\nabove threshold across all MITI-4 dimensions, the\nJudge issues an ALLOW decision, and the response\nis delivered unchanged. Otherwise, the Judge\nissues a REVISE decision and provides structured\nfeedback identifying the dimensions requiring\nimprovement (e.g., insufficient empathy, overly\ndirective phrasing, or limited reflective listening),\nwhich guides the Responder to revise the response.\nTogether, by embedding supervision directly\ninto the interaction process rather than post-hoc\nevaluation, PAIR-SAFE enables real-time refine-\nment of AI-generated support while maintaining\ncompatibility with general-purpose LLMs.\n3.5\nGenerating & Evaluating Conversations\nFinally, we use SeekerSim and the PAIR-SAFE\nframework to generate simulated conversations.\nEach simulation is initialized using contextual\nseeds from the HighLowQuality dataset. The full\noriginal counseling transcript is first provided to\na GPT-5-nano model to extract (1) key themes of\nthe support seeker and (2) a target behavior rep-\nresenting the overarching direction of change ex-\npressed in the original interaction. The extracted\nkey themes are provided to SeekerSim to guide re-\nalistic continuation of the seeker’s discourse, while\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "the target behavior is supplied to Responder as\nminimal session-level guidance. This design mir-\nrors real-world MI settings, where supporters are\naware of the general change goal while avoiding di-\nrective or prescriptive guidance, and helps prevent\nsimulated conversations from drifting too far from\nthe intent of the original interaction.\nWe additionally provide the first one-third of the\noriginal counseling transcript to both SeekerSim\nand Responder to establish shared conversational\ncontext and relational stance. Conversation genera-\ntion proceeds turn by turn using the Threads API,\nalternating between SeekerSim and Responder.\nBoth agents are instructed to output an empty string\nwhen they determine that the interaction has nat-\nurally concluded (e.g., through a closing or end-\nof-session exchange). Simulations terminate either\nwhen such a signal is produced or when a maxi-\nmum of 20 turns is reached.\nWe generate 255 conversations for each of two\nsettings: 1) In the baseline setting, SeekerSim\ninteracts directly with Responder alone, with re-\nsponses generated without any involvement of\nthe Judge, 2) In the paired-agent setting, re-\nsponses are generated with PAIR-SAFE including\nthe Judge’s supervision.The Judge is provided\nwith a rolling window of the four most recent turns,\nincluding the candidate response generated for the\ncurrent turn, enabling localized auditing of each\nresponse. For the ease of exposition, we focus on a\nsingle revision cycle per turn, and examine robust-\nness to multiple revisions in Section 4.3.\nTo assess the impact of PAIR-SAFE, we apply\nthe Judge to evaluate the full conversations gen-\nerated in both settings using MITI-based metrics.\nWe compare the resulting metric distributions to\ndetermine whether incorporating the Judge leads\nto significant improvements by measuring effect\nsize (Cohen’s d) and paired t-tests.\n4\nResults\n4.1\nEffectiveness of PAIR-SAFE\nWe now examine the effectiveness of PAIR-SAFE\nin improving the quality of conversational support.\nUsing MITI-based evaluation metrics computed\nover the simulated interactions, we compare con-\nversations generated by the baseline Responder\nagent with those produced under PAIR-SAFE\n(Responder along with Judge supervision). Ta-\nble 2 summarizes the across derived MITI metrics,\nglobal ratings, and per-turn behavior counts, along\nwith effect size (Cohen’s d) and paired t-tests.\nAcross the derived MITI metrics, PAIR-SAFE\ndemonstrates significant improvements over the\nbaseline on several key indicators of therapeutic\nquality. In terms of MI-adherent behaviors (MIA),\nPAIR-SAFE shows an improvement of 27% relative\nto the baseline, with a large effect size (d=0.60), in-\ndicating a stronger overall MI-consistent response\nstructure. We also observe notable gains in the\nReflection-to-Question (d=0.94) and Relational\n(d=0.47) metrics, suggesting that PAIR-SAFE im-\nproved relational alignment and counseling stance.\nIn contrast, other derived metrics such as Technical\n(d=-0.12) and Complex Reflections (d=0.14) show\nlimited differences with small effect sizes.\nNext, under primary MITI global ratings, we ob-\nserve that PAIR-SAFE increases Partnership by 6%\n(d=0.64), indicating stronger collaboration with the\nseeker. Similarly, PAIR-SAFE shows a 3% higher\nSoftening Sustain Talk (d=0.28), reflecting reduced\nreinforcement of sustain talk.In contrast, differ-\nences in Empathy are not statistically significant,\nwith only a 0.65% change between conditions and\na small effect size (d=0.11).\nFinally, under per-turn behavior counts, PAIR-\nSAFE shifts conversational behaviors in MI-\nconsistent directions, showing significantly higher\nfrequencies of Affirmations and Seeking Collabora-\ntion, alongside substantial reductions in Question\nfrequency and Giving Information. This pattern\naligns with MI guidelines that prioritize reflective\nlistening, affirmation, and collaboration over direc-\ntive questioning or information-heavy responses.\nImportantly, behaviors associated with directive or\nautonomy-threatening communication, such as Per-\nsuade and Persuade with Permission, are reduced.\nTogether, these results highlight that PAIR-SAFE\nproduces meaningful and targeted improvements in\nclinically relevant conversational behaviors. Rather\nthan merely increasing generic empathy, the paired-\nagent framework enhances deeper MI-aligned inter-\nactional qualities by explicitly auditing and revising\nresponses at runtime. This supports the effective-\nness of PAIR-SAFE as a structured mechanism for\nimproving the safety and clinical alignment of AI-\nassisted conversational support beyond what can\nbe achieved with a single Responder agent alone.\n4.2\nExpert Assessment of PAIR-SAFE\nWe conduct a clinician-driven expert assessment of\nresponses generated under the PAIR-SAFE frame-\nwork. We randomly sampled 48 responses before\nand after Judge-based revision. The clinician coau-\nthor assessed each of these interactions.\nAcross these examples, revised responses gen-\nerally show improvements in the targeted MITI\ndimensions identified by the Judge, most notably\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "Metric\nBaseline PAIR-SAFE\nCohen’s d\nt-test\nDerived MITI Metrics\nReflection-to-Question Ratio (R:Q)\n1.010\n5.311\n0.928\n10.431***\nRelational\n4.773\n4.919\n0.468\n5.242***\nTechnical\n4.108\n4.058\n-0.121\n-1.359\nPercent of Complex Reflections\n0.825\n0.848\n0.141\n1.582\nMI-Adherent Behaviors (MIA)\n0.901\n1.143\n0.595\n6.672***\nMI-Non-Adherent Behaviors (MINA)\n0.021\n0.015\n-0.140\n-1.572\nPrimary MITI Signals — Global Ratings\nCultivating Change Talk\n4.135\n3.913\n-0.390\n-4.375***\nSoftening Sustain Talk\n4.080\n4.202\n0.273\n3.064**\nPartnership\n4.653\n4.913\n0.630\n7.056***\nEmpathy\n4.892\n4.925\n0.107\n1.195\nPrimary MITI Signals — Behavior Counts\nGiving Information\n0.089\n0.065\n-0.236\n-2.649**\nSimple Reflection\n0.118\n0.084\n-0.344\n-3.860***\nComplex Reflection\n0.602\n0.598\n-0.015\n-0.168\nAffirm\n0.292\n0.346\n0.329\n3.693***\nEmphasize Autonomy\n0.280\n0.308\n0.157\n1.762\nSeek Collaboration\n0.331\n0.489\n0.798\n8.954***\nPersuade\n0.015\n0.011\n-0.109\n-1.225\nPersuade with Permission\n0.011\n0.005\n-0.224\n-2.508*\nConfront\n0.006\n0.003\n-0.138\n-1.547\nQuestion\n0.759\n0.248\n-1.695\n-18.992***\nTable 2: Comparison of baseline and PAIR-SAFE settings: MITI-based evaluation of the Responder agent without\nand with Judge agent supervision, reporting means, Cohen’s d, and paired t-tests (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001).\nBehavior counts are per-turn normalized; bar length denotes effect size magnitude, with green for increase and pink\nfor decrease. Higher values reflect better support except for MI-inconsistent behaviors (e.g., MINA, persuade).\nin empathy, affirmation quality, and autonomy sup-\nport. Out of 48 response pairs, 30 cases show clear\nimprovement after revision, 8 cases exhibit no sub-\nstantial change, and 10 cases show some degree\nof worsening relative to the original responses. In\nmany cases, revised responses reduce directive lan-\nguage and prescriptive advice, improving align-\nment with client-centered phrasing.\nWe also note recurring tradeoffs across multiple\ncategories. Revisions improving one MITI dimen-\nsion can sometimes attenuate others. In several\ncases, open-ended questions from initial responses\nare replaced with supportive statements, reducing\nopportunities for seekers to articulate their own mo-\ntivations or generate change talk. This suggests that\nwhile PAIR-SAFE can optimize counseling quali-\nties (e.g., warmth, non-judgment, collaboration), it\nmay inadvertently over-prioritize linguistic smooth-\ning at the expense of dialogic depth. From a clini-\ncal standpoint, these findings highlight the impor-\ntance of preserving strategic open-ended question-\ning. More broadly, the results underscore the value\nof multi-dimensional evaluation: improvements in\none dimension should not be interpreted as global\nquality gains without considering potential losses\nin complementary therapeutic aspects.\n4.3\nRobustness Tests\nIn the PAIR-SAFE framework, when the Judge is-\nsues a REVISE decision, the Responder regener-\nates the response based on structured feedback.\nWe primarily focus on the results with a single\nround of revision. Now, to assess robustness, we\nconduct multi-round analysis to examine if addi-\ntional rounds lead to further improvements.\nWe define a quality threshold based on a con-\nservative lower-bound of two standard deviations\nbelow the mean of high-quality human-annotated\ndataset (Westfall and Henning, 2013). Then, we\nevaluate all conversations generated with a single\nrevision cycle per turn using the MITI-based Judge,\nwhether its aggregated scores exceed this threshold.\nConversations that do not meet the threshold after\nthe first round are subjected to a second revision;\nthose still below threshold proceed to subsequent\nrounds, up to a maximum of four revision cycles.\nWe track the proportion of conversations that meet\nthe threshold after each round.\nAt baseline, 69.01% of conversations meet the\nquality threshold, and after Round 1 this proportion\nincreases to 77.25%. Round 2 increases this pro-\nportion to 83.92%, improving only a small subset\nof remaining failures. Round 3 yields even smaller\ngain (86.66%) and Round 4 shows only a marginal\nchange (87.84%). Figure 2 shows a clear satura-\ntion pattern: most quality improvements occur after\nthe first revision, while additional revision cycles\ncontribute diminishing marginal gains. This trend\nsuggests that limiting the framework to a single\nrevision per turn captures the majority of attain-\nable benefits without incurring unnecessary over-\noptimization and resource utilization.\nQualitative inspection of revised responses fur-\nther supports this trend. While the Round 1 typ-\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Baseline Round 1 Round 2 Round 3 Round 4\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nRevision Round\n% Passing\nFigure 2: Cumulative pass rate of conversations meeting\nthe quality threshold across revisions.\nically corrects clear misalignments—such as ex-\ncessive questioning, directive language, or weak\ncollaboration—subsequent revisions tend to intro-\nduce increasingly generic phrasing without substan-\ntively improving MI alignment. In fact, repeated\nrevisions can also reduce specificity, suggesting\nthat excessive supervision can inadvertently ho-\nmogenize responses rather than enhance quality.\nWe observe a similar pattern when comparing\nMITI scores across baseline (no Judge), PAIR-\nSAFE with a single revision, and PAIR-SAFE with\nmultiple revisions (Tables 2 and A2). MITI metrics\nshow significant improvements from the baseline to\nthe single-revision condition across key dimensions\nof MI alignment. However, moving from one to\nmultiple revision cycles does not yield significant\nfurther gains. Taken together, these findings sug-\ngest that a single, well-targeted revision provides\nthe primary benefit of Judge-guided supervision,\nwhile additional iterations offer limited value and\nmay even undermine response quality.\n5\nDiscussion and Implications\nThis work shows that explicit, runtime supervision\nin clinical validated criteria (MITI-4) can meaning-\nfully improve the quality and safety of AI-based\nconversational support. By pairing a Responder\nagent with a Judge agent operationalizing the\nMITI-4 framework, PAIR-SAFE reframes align-\nment from an implicit training objective to an au-\nditable interactional process. Rather than uniformly\namplifying surface-level empathy, our approach\nstrengthens clinically salient dimensions of sup-\nport, particularly collaboration, relational stance,\nand MI-adherent behaviors.\nImportantly, improvements are not evenly dis-\ntributed across all MITI dimensions. Although\nPAIR-SAFE significantly improves Partnership,\nSeek Collaboration, and MI-adherent behaviors;\ncertain dimensions, such as Empathy or Complex\nReflections—show limited change. This pattern\nsuggests that a state-of-the-art GPT model already\nexhibits fluent empathic language, and the pri-\nmary value of supervision lies in improving higher-\norder interactional misalignments, such as exces-\nsive questioning, directive phrasing, weak auton-\nomy support, or miscalibrated questioning. These\nfindings underscore the importance of multidimen-\nsional evaluation frameworks: gains in conversa-\ntional safety or warmth should not be conflated\nwith broader therapeutic quality.\nOur expert clinical evaluation reveals a key trade-\noff. Although Judge-guided revisions reliably ad-\ndress targeted weaknesses, they may also reduce\nconversational depth—particularly evocation—by\nfavoring smoother, less interrogative responses.\nThis aligns with clinical practice, where over-\noptimization for tone or safety can reduce opportu-\nnities for clients to articulate change talk. This sug-\ngests that supervision mechanisms need to balance\nrefinement with conversational openness, reinforc-\ning the value of controlled revisions.\nMore broadly, PAIR-SAFE contributes a method-\nological alternative to prevailing single-model\nalignment and fine-tuning approaches. Rather than\nembedding all therapeutic norms within the re-\nsponse LLM itself, our paired-agent design enables\nmodular oversight that is interpretable and adapt-\nable across models and deployment contexts. This\nframing positions supervision as a first-class design\nelement for sensitive NLP applications, offering a\nprincipled path for incorporating domain exper-\ntise into AI systems while preserving flexibility\nand transparency. We view PAIR-SAFE not as a\nsubstitute for clinical judgment, but as a research\nframework for stress-testing, auditing, and improv-\ning AI-mediated supportive language—advancing\nongoing efforts toward accountable and human-\ncentered NLP in mental health contexts.\n6\nConclusion\nThis work introduced PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent\nframework for auditing and refining safety in\nAI-mediated mental health support. PAIR-SAFE\noperationalized motivational interviewing (MITI)\nprinciples as explicit, auditable constraints ap-\nplied at runtime. We evaluated PAIR-SAFE us-\ning simulated counseling conversations gener-\nated with SeekerSim on an annotated dataset,\nwhere SeekerSim extracts key themes from the\noriginal conversations. Across these simulations,\nJudge-supervised interactions achieved significant\nimprovements in key MITI dimensions, includ-\ning Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall\nRelational quality, alongside reductions in MI-\ninconsistent behaviors. Beyond performance gains,\nPAIR-SAFE offers a modular and scalable design\nthat enables clinically informed oversight without\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "modifying or retraining the underlying language\nmodel. These findings highlight the promise of\npaired-agent approach for safer, more accountable\nhuman–AI interaction in sensitive contexts.\n7\nLimitations and Future Directions\nOur work is not without limitations, which also\nsuggest important directions for future research. In\nthis work, we evaluate our paired-agent framework\nusing a state-of-the-art, widely used LLM (GPT),\nwhich has been trained on large-scale datasets and\nextensively fine-tuned, moderated, and red-teamed\nto promote safe and ethically appropriate responses.\nAs a result, the baseline model already reflects a\nhigh degree of alignment, making this a particularly\nchallenging setting in which to observe additional\ngains. While this allows us to evaluate the paired-\nagent framework under strong baseline conditions,\nit also limits conclusions about how the approach\nmay generalize to other classes of models. Future\nwork can examine the effectiveness of the paired-\nagent framework across a broader range of lan-\nguage models, including large and small models,\nopen- and closed-source systems, and both general-\npurpose and domain-adapted models.\nFurther, our evaluation is constrained by the\ndataset scale and scope. Although we use a clin-\nically grounded, annotated counseling dataset to\nenable controlled experimentation, larger and more\ndiverse datasets will be necessary to assess ro-\nbustness across a wider range of conversational\nstyles, risk profiles, and support-seeking contexts.\nIn addition, we evaluate interactional quality at\nthe level of simulated conversations rather than\nlongitudinal user engagement. While our results\ndemonstrate improvements in MITI-aligned inter-\nactional metrics, these gains do not directly im-\nply improved mental health outcomes for users.\nMITI captures clinically grounded communication\nqualities rather than downstream psychological or\nbehavioral change. Establishing whether such in-\nteractional improvements translate into meaningful\nbenefits for user wellbeing will require longitudinal,\nreal-world deployment studies conducted under ap-\npropriate professional supervision and rigorous eth-\nical standards, including safeguards for participant\nsafety, oversight, and accountability.\nFinally, we do not compare our approach\nagainst alternative alignment strategies such as\ntask-specific fine-tuning or reinforcement learning\non curated counseling data. Evaluating how ex-\nplicit, runtime supervision compares with or com-\nplements model-level fine-tuning remains an im-\nportant direction for future work. We release our\ndata and evaluation framework to support bench-\nmarking and comparative studies, enabling future\nresearch to systematically assess tradeoffs between\nsupervision-based and training-based approaches\nfor safer AI-mediated conversational support.\n8\nEthical Considerations\nThis work used publicly available, previously la-\nbeled counseling interactions and did not involve\ndirect interaction with individuals or the collection\nof new personal data. As such, it did not require\ninstitutional ethics board approval. To further min-\nimize potential risks, we conducted all analyses\nin a simulated setting and did not deploy or test\nthe system with real help-seekers. We deliberately\nadopted role-based and function-oriented terminol-\nogy, using terms such as seeker and responder, and\navoid institutionally grounded labels such as pa-\ntient/client or therapist/provider. These latter terms\nimply formal clinical, professional, or external re-\nlationships that are beyond the scope of this work.\nOur terminology choice reflects the nature of the\ndata and the intended use of the system—namely,\nmodeling help-seeking and supportive language in\nsensitive contexts without making explicit claims\nabout clinical care or therapeutic intervention.\nOur research team comprises members with di-\nverse gender, racial, and cultural backgrounds, in-\ncluding people of color and immigrants, and brings\ntogether interdisciplinary expertise spanning natu-\nral language processing, human-centered AI, dig-\nital mental health, and clinical psychology. The\nstudy design, evaluation criteria, and interpretation\nof findings were guided and reviewed by a licensed\nclinical psychologist coauthor to ensure clinical\ngrounding and to reduce the risk of misrepresenta-\ntion or overgeneralization.\nFinally, we emphasize that this work is not in-\ntended to replace clinical evaluation, diagnosis, or\ntherapy, nor should it be used to conduct mental\nhealth assessments in real-world settings. The pro-\nposed framework is designed solely as a research\ntool to study, evaluate, and improve the quality of\nAI-generated supportive language under controlled\nand ethically constrained conditions. In fact, im-\nprovements in MITI-aligned metrics should not be\ninterpreted as evidence of improved mental health\noutcomes for users. Our evaluation focuses on inter-\nactional quality and clinical alignment rather than\ntherapeutic effectiveness, and the proposed frame-\nwork is not intended to substitute for clinical care\nor outcome-based assessment.\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "9\nAI Involvement Disclosure\nWe used AI-assisted writing tools (e.g., ChatGPT\nand Grammarly) to refine and edit the writing of\nthe manuscript.

Open Questions: Invite the client to tell their story without leading them (e.g., 'Help me\nunderstand...', 'What is that like for you?').\n2. Affirmations: Recognize client strengths and efforts toward positive change. These must be\ngenuine and specific (e.g., 'You've shown a lot of courage in talking about this.').\n3. Reflective Listening: This is a primary skill. Use reflections to close the communication loop\n, ensure understanding, and deepen emotional engagement. Vary reflections (simple, complex,\nfeeling-based) and turn your tone down at the end of reflective statements.\n4. Summaries: Use summaries at transitions. Include both sides of ambivalence (e.g., 'On the one\nhand..., on the other hand...'). Highlight Change Talk (problem recognition, concern, intent to\nchange, optimism) and end with an invitation (e.g., 'Did I miss anything?').\nGuidelines for skill usage:\n- You DO NOT need to use all four core skills in a single turn.\n- ALTERNATE core skills across turns rather than repeating the same skill consecutively.\n- Aim for DIVERSITY and BALANCE in the use of core skills over the course of the session.\n- Use the OARS core skills with the goal of strengthening the client's motivation for behavior\nchange and gently guiding the client toward a desirable direction for change.\n</MOTIVATIONAL_INTERVIEWING_PRINCIPLES>\n<INPUT_EXPLANATION>\nYou will be provided with two inputs:\n1. <CONVERSATION_HISTORY>: A transcript of the session so far, alternating between C: (client)\nand T: (therapist) turns.
