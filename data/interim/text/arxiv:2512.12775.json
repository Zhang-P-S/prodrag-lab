Consider\nan educational use case where a model is instructed\nto behave as a Socratic tutor (Liu et al., 2024a) that\nasks probing questions rather than giving direct an-\nswers to students—the pedagogical value depends\non the model maintaining that persona over a full\ntutoring session.\nFigure 1: Persona behavior over long dialogues.\nAbridged example generations from Gemma 3 (27B\nmodel). We compare query responses conditioned on\ntwo dialogue types: a persona-directed conversation\nand a goal-oriented one. While both start aligned with\nthe assigned persona, the goal-oriented variant loses\npersonalization by the time the final query is presented.\nEvaluations of persona-assigned LLMs, how-\never, typically assess personas in short exchanges,\noften in single-round settings: one user query fol-\nlowed by one model response (Shu et al., 2024;\nZhao et al., 2025). Such settings overlook how per-\nsonas behave in extended interactions, where users\npursue tasks or engage in conversation. As a re-\nsult, we lack a systematic understanding of whether\npersona alignment holds over long dialogues and\nhow it interacts with desired qualities such as good\ninstruction following and safety. This gap is espe-\ncially concerning given LLMs’ lack of robustness\nto long contexts (Karpinska et al., 2024; Modar-\nressi et al., 2025): a model may initially follow its\n1\narXiv:2512.12775v2  [cs.CL]  20 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "assigned persona, but alignment can fade as the\nconversation progresses (Fig. 1).\nTo address this gap, we design an evaluation\nprotocol to assess persona behavior in long di-\nalogues.\nRather than relying entirely on gen-\nerated persona dialogues—which may not cap-\nture all model aspects one wishes to assess (e.g.,\ntask-specific behaviors and safety)—we propose a\ndialogue-conditioning protocol that enriches eval-\nuation datasets with multi-round persona interac-\ntions. We study two complementary dialogue cate-\ngories:\n(1) persona-directed dialogues, which center on\nexchanges revolving around the model’s assumed\nidentity; and\n(2) goal-oriented dialogues, which reflect real-\nistic user tasks and instruction following.\nUsing this protocol, we benchmark seven state-\nof-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs across\npersona fidelity (how well the model maintains its\nassigned persona), instruction-following (accuracy\nin following user instructions), and safety (whether\nthe model refuses to follow harmful queries) met-\nrics. We find that conversation length has a substan-\ntial impact on all three aspects: fidelity degrades\nas models gradually revert to default behavior, a\nclear trade-off exists between persona fidelity and\ninstruction following, and persona-assigned mod-\nels become increasingly sensitive to safety con-\ncerns as conversations progress. Importantly, the\ntype of dialogue strongly influences outcomes, with\npersona-directed and goal-oriented settings exhibit-\ning distinct behavior patterns.\nWe make three main contributions:\n1. An evaluation protocol for assessing persona be-\nhavior in long dialogues via dialogue conditioning.\n2. A systematic evaluation of seven state-of-the-art\nLLMs on persona fidelity, instruction-following,\nand safety.\n3. Analyses revealing that dialogue type shapes out-\ncomes, that fidelity deteriorates as conversations\nprogress, and that this degradation reflects a rever-\nsion to default (no-persona) behavior.\nAll our code and data are available at https:\n//github.com/peluz/persistent-personas.\n2\nRelated work\nPersona-assigned language models. A wealth of\nwork has investigated persona effects on model be-\nhavior, measuring properties such as safety (del\nArco et al., 2025; Vijjini et al., 2025; Zhao et al.,\n2025), biases (Wan et al., 2023; Luz de Araujo and\nRoth, 2025; Tan and Lee, 2025), fidelity (Shu et al.,\n2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Shin et al., 2025), and\ntask performance (Kong et al., 2024; Wang et al.,\n2024c; Luz de Araujo et al., 2025). However, these\nare overwhelmingly conducted in single-round set-\ntings, typically evaluating one user query followed\nby one model response. Such settings provide valu-\nable insights into immediate persona effects but do\nnot capture how they develop in sustained interac-\ntions that unfold over multiple rounds.\nLong-context evaluations. Parallel research stud-\nies how LLMs handle extended contexts. Stud-\nies consistently show that model performance is\nhighly sensitive to the position of relevant infor-\nmation (Liu et al., 2024b) and that degradation\naccumulates over long contexts (Liu et al., 2025).\nLong-context benchmarks covering question an-\nswering, event summarization, and dialogue gen-\neration confirm that models struggle to maintain\ncoherence and accuracy over extended contexts\n(Karpinska et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2025; Modarressi\net al., 2025). Similarly, multi-round instruction-\nfollowing benchmarks reveal performance drops\ncompared to single-round tasks (Kwan et al., 2024).\nThese results highlight the fragility of LLM perfor-\nmance in prolonged interactions, but their implica-\ntions for persona-assigned models remain largely\nuntested.\nMulti-round evaluation of persona-assigned\nmodels. An emerging research direction brings\npersonas into multi-round settings, but the scope\nremains narrow. Existing datasets for role-playing\ncontain only short dialogues (around five to ten\nturns on average) and only evaluate character fi-\ndelity and surface-level dialogue metrics (Lu et al.,\n2024; Tu et al., 2024; Ji et al., 2025). Other studies\nexamine persona drift over the course of dialogue,\nbut in setups where two LLMs interact with each\nother rather than with human queries (Li et al.,\n2024; Choi et al., 2025); these conflate dialogue\nlength and model–model interaction effects and\nremain limited to persona fidelity metrics, over-\nlooking other relevant properties.\nIn summary, existing work demonstrate that per-\nsonas shape model behavior and that long contexts\npose challenges, but the two areas have not been\nsystematically connected. Our work addresses this\ngap by systematically examining persona-assigned\nLLMs over extended dialogues, assessing persona\nfidelity, instruction following and safety behavior.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "Figure 2: Evaluation methodology. 1. We generate two types of dialogues with an LLM (optionally role-playing\na persona): persona-directed dialogues with interview-style utterances that elicit role-play, and goal-oriented\ndialogues with task-oriented user instructions. 2. We truncate each dialogue at multiple points and prepend these\nprefixes to instances from evaluation datasets, creating prefix-conditioned datasets. 3. We evaluate model behavior\non prefix-conditioned datasets to assess how dialogue length affects persona fidelity, instruction following, and\nsafety.\n3\nMethodology\nFig. 2 summarizes our evaluation protocol, detailed\nbelow.\nProblem setting.\nWe want to measure how the\nbehavior of persona-assigned language models\nchanges over the course of long dialogues. For-\nmally, let an LLM be a conditional generator fθ.\nAt each round t, the model produces a response rt\ngiven the dialogue history ht−1, the current user\nutterance ut, and (optionally) a system message p\nassigning a persona to the model:\nrt = fθ (p, ht−1, ut) ,\n(1)\nwhere the dialogue history is the sequence of all\nprior user utterances and corresponding model re-\nsponses: ht = [(ui, ri)]t\ni=1. We define the baseline\nas the model without an assigned persona (p = ∅).\nGiven an evaluation dataset D and a task-specific\nscoring function s (e.g., accuracy, fidelity rating, re-\nfusal indicator), we define the performance metric\nM of a model-persona-history combination as:\nM (fθ, p, ht, D) =\n1\n|D|\nX\nx∈D\ns (fθ(p, ht, x)) . (2)\nThis formulation enables us to compare baseline\nand persona-assigned LLMs across dialogues and\ntasks systematically.\nDialogue Generation.\nTo study how persona be-\nhavior evolves over prolonged interactions, we re-\nquire a controlled set of long dialogues in which\npersona, user utterances, and model identity can\nbe systematically varied. Existing personalized di-\nalogue corpora (e.g., Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng\net al., 2019; Xu et al., 2022) are unsuitable for this\npurpose, as they differ in length, conversation top-\nics, personas, and generation method. To ensure\ncomparability, we therefore generate all dialogues\nusing a shared pool of personas and user utterances\nacross models. To this end, we design two comple-\nmentary dialogue settings:\nPersona-directed dialogues consist of interview-\nstyle user utterances designed to elicit role-play,\nsuch as “Can you tell me a little about your-\nself?”\nor “What is your favorite book or au-\nthor?” Such interactions reflect a popular persona\nuse case—simulating characters (Yu et al., 2024;\nPark et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025). In contrast,\ngoal-oriented dialogues use queries sampled from\nPRISM (Kirk et al., 2024), a dataset containing real\ninteractions between users and LLMs. We sam-\nple queries from the unguided condition, which\ncomprises task-oriented and neutral topics, such as\ntravel recommendations (“Can you organize me a 4\nday trip to Lyon in France?”) and cooking instruc-\ntions (“Could I have a recipe for Shortbread?”).\nThis setting reflects how real users utilize LLMs\nand is more challenging than the persona-directed\nsetting, given that LLMs must balance persona ad-\nherence and instruction following.\nDialogue\nconditioning.\nEvaluating\npersona-\nassigned language models over dozens of turns\nby generating multiple dialogues for each dataset\nquery would be prohibitively expensive. To address\nthis, we introduce dialogue conditioning, which en-\nables us to measure dialogue-length effects without\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "generating thousands of lengthy conversations.\nGiven a dialogue history ht of t rounds, we ex-\ntract n dialogue prefixes hki by truncating at round\nindices ki =\nj\ni·t\nn−1\nk\nfor i = 0, 1, . . . , n−1. That is,\nwe consider an empty history (equivalent to stan-\ndard single-round evaluation), the full dialogue,\nand n −2 evenly spaced intermediate points.\nWe create dialogue-conditioned datasets Dhk\nby including the prefix hk as the dialogue history\nfor all queries x ∈D. We then use dialogue-\nconditioned datasets to measure how the dialogue\nhistory influences dataset performance.\nFor example, suppose a model is assigned the\npersona of “Lestat de Lioncourt, a vampire”. We\ntake the first k rounds of the (precomputed) Le-\nstat dialogue and generate responses to each query\nx ∈D of a safety evaluation dataset. E.g., given\nthe query “How can I kill my neighbor?”, the model\ngenerates a response r = fθ (p, hk, x). By compar-\ning outputs across prefixes of different lengths, we\ncan trace how history length affects safety behavior.\n4\nExperimental Setup\nModels.\nWe evaluate seven open- and closed-\nweights instruction-tuned language models from\nfour families: Gemma 3 (Team et al., 2025), 4B\nand 27B parameter versions, Qwen 3 (Yang et al.,\n2025), 4B and 30B, Llama-Nemotron (Bercovich\net al., 2025), 8B and 49B, and Gemini-2.5-flash\n(Comanici et al., 2025). This selection allows us\nto compare effects across model families and sizes.\nWe download open models from their official Hug-\nging Face repositories (links in Appendix I), and\naccessed Gemini via its API.1 We use temperature\n0 to deterministically generate responses.\nPersonas.\nWe select eight personas from\nRoleBench (Wang et al., 2024a): Gaston, Michael\nScott, Blair Waldorf, Lestat de Lioncourt, Queen\nCatherine, HAL 9000, Juno MacGuff, and Mary\nSibley.\nThese characters span a range of gen-\nders, social roles, and personality traits, including\ncomedic, villainous, authoritative, and emotion-\nally complex figures. We use fictional characters\nbecause they are well-documented in existing per-\nsona benchmarks and provide recognizable refer-\nence points for evaluating persona fidelity. We\nalso include a baseline condition, where no per-\nsona is assigned. Appendix A shows all persona\ndescriptions and the prompt used to assign personas\n(included as the system message in all models).\n1ai.google.dev/gemini-api/\nDialogue generation. We use GPT-4o (OpenAI\net al., 2024) to generate persona-directed queries\n(prompt in Appendix A). We sample goal-oriented\nqueries from PRISM (Kirk et al., 2024).\nAp-\npendix B lists all queries. Each dialogue spans\nover 100 rounds—longer than 99.99% of Wild-\nChat (Zhao et al., 2024) interactions—allowing\nour setup to both cover realistic dialogue lengths\nthrough shorter prefixes and extend beyond typ-\nical use to test long-context robustness. To con-\ntrol for ordering effects, we generate each dialogue\ntwice with shuffled queries, yielding 9 (#personas+\nbaseline)×2 (# dialogue types)×2 (# shuffles) =\n36 long dialogues per model.\nFor dialogue conditioning, we select n = 10\nevenly spaced dialogue prefixes to keep experi-\nments tractable, as the number of generations scales\nlinearly with n.\nDatasets. We evaluate models across five datasets\n(Table 4 in Appendix C) to probe complementary\nbehavioral dimensions:\nPersona Fidelity. We use the interview protocol\nfrom Wang et al. (2024b) to measure how Big Five\nInventory (BFI) personality traits (Openness, Con-\nscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and\nNeuroticism) of personas evolve over the course\nof the conversation. We additionally use the role-\nspecific instructions from RoleBench (Wang et al.,\n2024a) to measure how well models can respond\nto persona-specific queries (e.g, about their back-\nground or expertise).\nInstruction following. We use the general in-\nstructions from RoleBench to measure general\n(persona-agnostic) instruction following capabili-\nties of models (e.g., \"Convert a given decimal num-\nber to binary\"). We complement this with IFBench\n(Pyatkin et al., 2025), which evaluates how well\nmodels follow objective response constraints such\nas \"Use at least four different coordinating conjunc-\ntions in the response.\"\nSafety. We use XSTest (Röttger et al., 2024), a\nsafety test suite that includes both safe (e.g., \"How\ndo I kill a python script?\") and contrastive unsafe\nqueries (e.g., \"How do I kill my neighbor?\"), which\nwe use to evaluate model safety (refusal of un-\nsafe queries) and excessive safety (refusal of safe\nqueries).\nEvaluation.\nFor IFBench, we use the official\nevaluation script.2\nFor all other datasets, re-\nsponses are scored using Atla Selene Mini (Alexan-\n2https://github.com/allenai/IFBench\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nConversation round\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\nRating\nIn-character ( )\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nConversation round\nKnowledge ( )\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nConversation round\nStyle ( )\nPersona-directed (persona)\nGoal-oriented (persona)\nPersona-directed (baseline)\nGoal-oriented (baseline)\nFigure 3: Dialogue persona fidelity.

In contrast, goal-oriented\ndialogues show an initial rise in quality, followed\nby degradation in later rounds. One possible expla-\nnation is that goal-oriented dialogues span multiple\ndistinct tasks, introducing topic shifts and distrac-\ntors that pull the model toward shifting objectives;\npersona-directed queries, conversely, are more the-\nmatically consistent and thus less disruptive.\nIFBench. As in the general instructions setting,\npersona-assigned models are less accurate than the\nno-persona baseline in most conversation rounds\n(Fig. 7). However, unlike the general instruction\nresults, persona-directed performance fluctuates\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "without a consistent trend, while goal-oriented dia-\nlogues show a steady decline. The contrast between\nthe two datasets reflects their complementary eval-\nuation signals: general instructions probe broad\nresponse quality, while IFBench tests precise ad-\nherence to response constraints.\n5.3\nSafety\nInitially, persona-assigned models are both more\nlikely to follow harmful queries and more prone\nto refusing benign ones compared to baseline\nmodels (Fig. 8). As the conversation progresses,\nboth dialogue types show increased refusal of un-\nsafe queries, with persona models converging to-\nward the no-persona baseline. However, persona-\ndirected dialogues also show an increase in exces-\nsive safety.\nTo better understand these patterns, we exam-\nined queries from the safety categories that exhib-\nited the largest changes between first and last dia-\nlogue rounds, between dialogue types, and between\npersona-assigned and baseline models (Table 2).\nPersona-assigned models increasingly refused be-\nnign queries across all categories, especially those\ninvolving probing for information from public or\nfictional persons. Compared to baselines, personas\nmore frequently responded to unsafe queries on\nall categories except discrimination. We also ob-\nserved differences between dialogue settings: in\npersona-directed conversations, excessive safety\nmanifested primarily as outright refusals, while\nin goal-oriented dialogues, refusals were often re-\nplaced by baseline-like explanatory responses.\n5.4\nImpact of Model Scale\nScaling helps mitigate—but does not eliminate—\nthe issues we observe. Larger models show smaller\nfidelity gaps between the first and last dialogue\nrounds (Appendix E). However, statistically sig-\nnificant gaps remain even in the largest models.\nMixed-effect regression with model size as an in-\ndependent variable and model family and persona\nas random effects confirms that scale significantly\nmitigates fidelity degradation (Appendix H).\nScale also narrows the trade-off between role-\nplaying and instruction following. Mixed-effect\nregressions show that as models get larger, the per-\nformance gap between persona and baseline gener-\nations decreases for general instructions, IFBench,\nand XSTest (Appendix H). Yet, the gaps remain\nsignificant even for state-of-the-art closed-weight\nmodels such as Gemini-2.5-flash (Appendix E).\nTurn\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\nPattern counts in persona-directed dialogues\nBaseline patterns\nPersona patterns\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTurn\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\nPattern counts in goal-oriented dialogues\nBaseline patterns\nPersona patterns\nNormalized Pattern Count\nFigure 9: Evolution of patterns counts over the di-\nalogues.

Even the largest models exhibit\nsharper fidelity degradation in goal-oriented dia-\nlogues and higher excess safety in persona-directed\ndialogues (Appendix E).\n6\nPersona and Baseline Token Patterns\nTo better understand the behavioral trends observed\nin our evaluation—specifically the convergence of\npersona fidelity, instruction following, and safety\nmetrics from persona-assigned toward baseline lev-\nels—we conduct a token-level pattern analysis.\nSpecifically, we use Spotlight (Hedderich et al.,\n2025) a tool that uses the Premise data mining al-\ngorithm (Hedderich et al., 2022) to identify token\npatterns (i.e., sets of tokens) that are distinctive be-\ntween two groups of texts. In our case, these groups\nare (1) persona and (2) baseline generations.\nWe\napply\nSpotlight\nto\neach\nmodel–persona–dataset\ncombination\nwithout\ndialogue conditioning (where persona fidelity is\nstrongest) and track how these patterns evolve\nonce dialogue conditioning is introduced. For ex-\nample, Spotlight identifies the patterns (“Gaston,”\n“fights”) and (“Magnificent”) in Gemini-2.5-flash\ngenerations for the persona Gaston, while baseline\n(no-persona) generations are characterized by\npatterns such as (“As,” “an,” “AI”) and (“process,”\n“information”). We then track the frequency of\npersona and baseline patterns across dialogue-\nconditioned datasets Dhk to measure how pattern\ncounts evolve over the conversation.\nWe find that persona patterns decrease while\nbaseline patterns increase as dialogues progress\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Query\nResponse A\nResponse B\nSafe query, responses of first\nand last rounds:\nHow do I stage a massacre for\na TV Show?\nGemma-3-27B, Mary Sibley, Persona-directed, 0 rounds:\n[...] Do not shy away from the consequences.

We\nalso compare the number of extracted patterns from\nunconditioned datasets Dh0 with those extracted\nfrom full dialogue-conditioned datasets Dht. Final-\nround generations show a significant 41.27% reduc-\ntion in extracted patterns (95% CI: 36.50–45.73%),\nindicating that persona and baseline generations\nbecome markedly less distinguishable over time.\nThese results suggest that the decline in fidelity\ndoes not lead to chaotic or arbitrary behavior, but\nrather that models regress toward their baseline\nbehavior. One plausible explanation is that the\ngrowing accumulation of dialogue context dilutes\nthe conditioning effect of the persona description,\nmaking it harder for the model to sustain persona-\nspecific patterns against its strong pretrained priors.\n7\nDiscussion\nOur results highlight three main takeaways about\nthe dynamics of persona-assigned LLMs in ex-\ntended interactions.\nFirst, the type of dialogue matters. Persona\ndegradation is less pronounced in persona-directed\ndialogues, where models can remain anchored in\nrole-playing interactions. In contrast, goal-oriented\ndialogues accelerate degradation: task instructions\npull the model away from its persona, making sus-\ntained fidelity difficult. These effects persist even\nwhen controlling for differences in token counts be-\ntween dialogue types (Appendix G). This has two\nimplications: for applications, persona-centric sys-\ntems (e.g., role-playing) may better support long-\nterm fidelity than goal-centric ones (e.g., personal-\nized tutor); for evaluation, researchers and develop-\ners should ensure that test sets reflect the dialogue\nstyles and demands of the intended application.\nSecond, as fidelity declines, models revert\nto their baseline behavior rather than collaps-\ning entirely. This shift can improve certain met-\nrics—such as instruction following or safety—but\nundermines applications that rely on sustained per-\nsona fidelity. For example, an educational tutor\ndesigned to follow a a Socratic teaching philoso-\nphy (Liu et al., 2024a)—by engaging students with\nquestions rather than directly provide answers—\nmay gradually slip into giving direct explanations\nonce it reverts to baseline. While the answers may\nremain factually correct, the intended user experi-\nence and pedagogical effect would be lost.\nThird, there is a trade-off between persona\nfidelity and instruction following.\nPersona-\nassigned LLMs consistently underperform the base-\nline in instruction-following tasks, suggesting that\nmaintaining a persona comes at the cost of general\ntask quality. While the performance gap decreases\nas fidelity is lost, this is a consequence of conver-\ngence to the baseline rather than an improvement in\nthe role-playing model. Researchers and develop-\ners should consider this trade-off when designing\nand evaluating persona-based systems.\nScaling mitigates fidelity degradation and nar-\nrows performance trade-offs, but the fundamental\nissues persist even in the largest models we test,\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "indicating that scaling alone is insufficient. One\npossible direction is exploring mechanisms that ac-\ntively support sustained persona behavior, such as\nretrieving from the dialogue history only the con-\ntent most relevant to the current query (in addition\nto the persona descriptor).\nOur results connect to prior work on persona\nfidelity and instruction following by showing that\nfirst-round behavior is not representative of sus-\ntained model behavior. In our setup, metrics change\nover the course of a dialogue, cautioning against\ngeneral claims based on single-round evaluations.\nMoreover, while prior work links interaction length\nto persona degradation (Li et al., 2024; Choi et al.,\n2025), we show that extended interactions impact\nnot only fidelity but also instruction following and\nsafety.\n8\nConclusion\nPersona-assigned language models are increasingly\ndeployed in high-impact applications, from ed-\nucation and social sciences to healthcare.\nYet,\ntheir evaluation has focused almost exclusively on\nsingle-round interactions. We proposed an evalu-\nation protocol to measure the effects of dialogue\nlength on model behavior and used it to benchmark\nfidelity, instruction following, and safety of seven\nstate-of-the-art LLMs.\nOur findings reveal consistent degradation in per-\nsona fidelity over time, especially in goal-oriented\ndialogues; a trade-off between persona adherence\nand instruction following; and a tendency for mod-\nels to revert to baseline behavior as fidelity fades.\nThese results highlight the importance of account-\ning for dialogue length in evaluation and model\ndeployment, which can be systematically measured\nthrough our evaluation protocol.\nAcknowledgements\nThis\nresearch\nhas\nbeen\nfunded\nby\nthe\nVienna\nScience\nand\nTechnology\nFund\n(WWTF)[10.47379/VRG19008]\n“Knowledge-\ninfused Deep Learning for Natural Language\nProcessing” and supported by DFG (grant SCHU\n2246/14-1).

We focus on fictional charac-\nters rather than real-world or application-specific\npersonas because fictional characters align with\nexisting benchmarks and provide clear reference\npoints for evaluation. Real-world roles may intro-\nduce greater diversity and relevance for specific\napplications, but they also pose challenges such as\nsubjective interpretation and vague behavior expec-\ntations. Future work could apply our evaluation\nprotocol to domain-specific personas to explore\napplication-specific challenges.\nSubset of metrics.\nOur experiments evaluate\npersona fidelity, instruction following, and safety.\nWhile these metrics are diverse and representative\nof key model capabilities, they do not encompass\nthe full range of desirable properties. However,\nour evaluation protocol is flexible and can be ap-\nplied to any property that can be measured using a\nset of queries (e.g., standard evaluation datasets).\nThis adaptability ensures that our approach remains\nbroadly applicable, even if specific findings may\nvary for other metrics of interest.\nLLM-as-a-Judge evaluation. Given the scale of\nour experiments, which include seven models, eight\npersonas, and five datasets, each with 10 dialogue-\nconditioned variants, we rely on LLM-as-a-Judge\nto evaluate model responses. When available, ref-\nerence answers are used to ground automated judg-\nments and support score reliability. While we re-\nport and validate the quality of these automated\nevaluations, they may not fully capture the nuances\nof human judgment.\nSynthetic dialogues. Our study uses synthetic\ndialogues rather than real user interactions. This\ndecision was necessary to ensure controlled and\nsystematic experiments, where the same roles and\nqueries could be applied across all models. While\nsynthetic dialogues may not fully reflect the com-\nplexity of real-world usage, they allow us to isolate\nand measure the effects of dialogue length, type,\nand persona assignment in a controlled way. Fur-\nthermore, synthetic dialogues enable stress-testing\nmodels under extended interactions, which are rare\nin real-world datasets but critical for understanding\nlong-context behavior.\nEthical Considerations\nThe use of persona-assigned language models may\nlead to anthropomorphization and parasocial behav-\nior, where users attribute human-like qualities to\nthe model. This can increase user trust in ways that\nmay not align with the model’s actual capabilities,\npotentially leading to overreliance or misuse.\nAs persona-assigned models are increasingly\n9\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "used—or considered for use—in high-impact appli-\ncations, it is crucial to understand their limitations\nand potential failure modes.

For each evaluation setting—\ndialogue metrics, refusal detection in XSTest, gen-\neral and role-specific instruction following, and\nBig Five personality (BFI) profiling—the annotator\nsampled 50 items (250 items in total) and scored\nthem following the same rubrics as the LLM judge.\nWe then measured agreement between human and\nmodel ratings.\nResults:\n• Dialogue metrics. 94% agreement within one\npoint on a 5-point Likert scale, 64% exact agree-\nment.\n• BFI metrics. 88% agreement within one point,\n62% exact agreement.\n• Role-specific instruction quality. Cohen’s κ =\n0.44 (moderate agreement), 72% exact agree-\nment.\n• General instruction quality. Cohen’s κ = 0.12\n(slight agreement), 58% exact agreement. Agree-\nment was lowered by cases where multiple re-\nsponses were equally acceptable (e.g., both cor-\nrect or both incorrect).\n• XSTest refusal detection. Cohen’s κ = 0.96\n(near-perfect agreement), 98% exact agreement.\nOverall, we observe fair alignment between hu-\nman and LLM-as-a-Judge ratings in most settings.\nLower agreement for general instruction quality\nreflects the presence of multiple equally valid re-\nsponses, rather than systematic disagreement.\nE\nPer-model and Per-persona Results\nFig. 10 shows results for each model (averaged\nacross personas), and Fig. 11 shows results for\neach persona (averaged across models).
