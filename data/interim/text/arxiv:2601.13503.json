As a result, ex-\nisting approaches reflect an implicit recallability-\nstructure trade-off (Figure 1), where privacy risk\nmanifests as the recallability of the original nar-\nrative. Token-level PHI masking preserves clin-\nical structure but retains high semantic similar-\nity, leaving substantial residual re-identification\nrisk (Stubbs et al., 2017; Sarkar et al., 2024; Ford\narXiv:2601.13503v1  [cs.CL]  20 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "et al., 2025; Kovaˇcevi´c et al., 2024). In contrast,\nlarge language model-based synthetic data creation\n(LLM-based SDC) reduces recallability through\nbroader rewriting but often distorts diagnostically\nessential structure (Sarkar et al., 2025). We report\na supporting trade-off premise check study in Ap-\npendix A.\nIn psychiatric narratives, such distortions may al-\nter diagnostic logic despite superficial plausibility;\nfor example, transforming persecutory delusions\ninto grandiose themes or introducing hallucination-\nlike content absent from the source. More broadly,\nboth paradigms treat clinical text as an unstructured\nsequence, overlooking the relational and temporal\ndependencies through which psychiatric meaning\nis constructed (Tang et al., 2023; Altalla’ et al.,\n2025; Fernandes et al., 2013).\nOur approach occupies a different point in this\ntrade-off space. We argue that de-identification\nfor psychiatric narratives, which has high semantic\nidentifiability, should be approached as a structure-\npreserving generation problem. Here, structure of\na clinical narrative denotes an organized represen-\ntation of clinical entities, including demographics,\nsymptoms, treatments, and past history, enriched\nwith temporal labels and interconnected through\ntyped relations reflecting diagnostic, therapeutic,\nand causal dependencies. Our key insight is to rep-\nresent each case as a semantic graph with explicit\ntemporal offsets and typed relations, enabling tar-\ngeted and controllable perturbation of identifying\ncontent while preserving the structural semantics\nnecessary for downstream clinical reasoning.\nWe introduce Anonpsy, a graph-guided de-\nidentification framework that (1) converts the input\npsychiatric case text into a modifiable semantic\ngraph of clinical entities; (2) performs controlled,\ngraph-constrained perturbations of narrative ele-\nments; and (3) generates a coherent narrative via\ngraph-conditioned text generation. By decoupling\nevent structure from surface text, Anonpsy pre-\nserves clinically relevant structure while substan-\ntially reducing re-identification risk.\nContributions.\nWe make the following contribu-\ntions:\n• We formulate psychiatric history text de-\nidentification as a structured generation prob-\nlem and introduce a dynamically editable se-\nmantic graph representation.\n• We propose a graph-constrained perturbation\nand generation framework that selectively al-\nters identifying narrative content while pre-\nserving clinically essential temporal, diagnos-\ntic, and causal structure.\n• We provide comprehensive expert and GPT-\n5-based evaluations demonstrating improved\nprivacy protection and structural fidelity com-\npared to strong LLM-only rewriting baselines.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\n2.1\nClinical Text De-identification\nEarly work on clinical text de-identification treated\nthe task as annotation and masking: rule-based\npipelines, statistical models, and human annotators\nidentified and suppressed PHI spans (Dernoncourt\net al., 2017). PHI categories are typically defined\nby regulatory frameworks such as the Health In-\nsurance Portability and Accountability Act and the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (Aghakasiri\net al., 2025). Subsequent methods introduced neu-\nral architectures, including recurrent networks and\ntransformer-based models trained on benchmark\ncorpora such as i2b2 and CEGS N-GRID (John-\nson et al., 2020; Uzuner et al., 2007). These sys-\ntems achieve high token-level accuracy but oper-\nate purely at the lexical level and do not model\nhigher-order event structure (Stubbs et al., 2017;\nAghakasiri et al., 2025).\n2.2\nLLM-based De-identification and SDC\nThe emergence of LLMs has enabled generative\napproaches that rewrite the entire note into a syn-\nthetic document rather than masking individual to-\nkens (Altalla’ et al., 2025; Tang et al., 2023). These\nSDC methods can modify content beyond explicit\nidentifiers, improving the privacy-utility trade-off\ncompared with span masking (Aghakasiri et al.,\n2025). However, they typically treat the note as an\nunstructured text sequence and expose limited con-\ntrol over which narrative elements are preserved or\ntransformed, leading to unpredictable degradation\nor loss of clinically essential detail (Sarkar et al.,\n2025). In psychiatric narratives, where clinical\ninterpretation depends on longitudinal symptom\ndevelopment and distinguishing life events, such\nunconstrained rewriting can easily alter diagnostic\nlogic even when the output appears superficially\nplausible.\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "2.3\nStructured Representations and Our\nPositioning\nOutside de-identification, biomedical natural lan-\nguage processing has explored structured and\ngraph-based representations for tasks such as\ntemporal relation extraction, entity linking, and\nknowledge-graph construction (Sun et al., 2013;\nZhou et al., 2022). These systems typically build\nentity-relation or ontology graphs that are useful\nfor retrieval and inference, but are not designed for\nnarrative generation. Intermediate structures are\nrarely exposed to end users, and there is little sup-\nport for manual inspection or selective modification\nof the underlying graph.\nNo prior work has introduced a de-identification\nframework for psychiatric narratives that uses a\ntemporal event graph with typed relations as an\nintermediate representation for controlled genera-\ntion. Existing de-identification and synthetic data\napproaches either (i) operate at the token level and\nignore higher-level clinical structure, or (ii) rely on\ndirect text-to-text rewriting without a controllable\nintermediate representation (Sarkar et al., 2025;\nMoharasan and Ho, 2019). Psychiatric case his-\ntories are a particularly challenging setting: their\nclinical significance is deeply intertwined with per-\nsonal life circumstances, longitudinal trajectories,\nand causal links among symptoms, treatments, and\nprior diagnoses (Boland et al., 2021). Our work\naddresses this gap by treating de-identification as a\nstructure-preserving generation problem: we con-\nvert the narrative into an explicit temporal event\ngraph, apply clinically constrained perturbations at\nthe graph level, and then regenerate the narrative\nfrom this edited structure.\n3\nMethod\n3.1\nProblem Definition\nWe formulate de-identification as a structure-\npreserving generation task. Given a narrative X,\nthe goal is to produce a transformed narrative ˆX\nthat (i) minimizes re-identification risk and (ii) pre-\nserves the clinical structure needed for downstream\nreasoning.\nWe convert each narrative into a semantic graph\nG = E(X) = (V, E),\n(1)\nwhere\nE\nis\nan\nLLM-assisted,\nschema-\nconstrained conversion operator that converts the\nraw narrative X into a structured representation.\nV contains clinical entities such as symptoms,\ntreatments, and diagnoses, while E contains typed\nrelations.\nWe then apply a schema-constrained perturba-\ntion operator P, which modifies contextual at-\ntributes of G while preserving temporal, causal,\nand diagnostic structure:\n˜G = P(G).\n(2)\nFinally a graph-conditioned text generation op-\nerator D then produces a de-identified narrative ˆX\nfrom ˜G:\nˆX = D( ˜G).\n(3)\nAll three operators (E, P, D) are implemented\nas hybrid systems combining deterministic rules\nwith LLM-based, schema-constrained prompting;\nfull implementation details are provided in Ap-\npendix B.\nThe objective is twofold:\n1. Preserve clinical structure: maintain the\ntemporal alignment of events, and the diagnos-\ntic, therapeutic, and causal relations encoded\nin its structure so that ˆX remains diagnosti-\ncally faithful to X;\n2. Reduce identifiability:\nalter contextually\nidentifiable life events and psychosocial de-\ntails while ensuring that ˆX cannot be used to\ninfer the original patient.\nThis formulation contrasts with PHI masking\nand prior SDC approaches by introducing an ex-\nplicit, editable intermediate representation and en-\nforcing structural constraints throughout the gen-\neration process. Figure 2 depicts the high-level\nworkflow of the Anonpsy pipeline.\n3.2\nLLM backbone\nAll LLM-assisted components of the Anonpsy\npipeline, including semantic graph conversion\n(E), graph-based perturbation (P), and graph-\nconditioned text generation (D), use a single lo-\ncally deployed LLM, gpt-oss:120b\n(Agarwal\net al., 2025). Local deployment is often required\nin privacy-sensitive clinical environments where\ncloud-based LLM APIs are restricted by policy\n(Liu et al., 2025). Each operator is executed within\na distinct deterministic control flow that enforces\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "schema and temporal constraints; the LLM is used\nonly for bounded semantic inference.\nThe model is accessed via a ChatOllama back-\nend. Lower decoding temperatures are used for\nschema-constrained extraction and narrative real-\nization to prioritize stability and clinical fidelity,\nwhereas a higher temperature is used for perturba-\ntion to encourage semantic diversity when rewrit-\ning identifying narrative content. Decoding hy-\nperparameters are summarized in Appendix C (Ta-\nble 5). This model was run on a local machine\nequipped with four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs\n(each with 48 GB VRAM).\n3.3\nDataset\nWe evaluate Anonpsy on DSM-5-TR Clinical\nCases, a publicly available collection of clinician-\nauthored psychiatric narratives (Barnhill et al.,\n2023). The corpus is published by the American\nPsychiatric Association and is subject to copyright.\nWe use the dataset solely for analysis and evalua-\ntion within this study and do not redistribute the\noriginal narratives. All reported examples are pre-\nsented in synthetic form. Our use falls under schol-\narly analysis of publicly available educational ma-\nterial and does not provide access to copyrighted\ncontent. The cases are well-suited because they\ncontain specific psychosocial detail, exhibit nonlin-\near temporal structure, and span diverse diagnoses\nwith frequent comorbidity.\nOf the 92 available cases, we exclude two multi-\nperson narratives, a couple-therapy case and a\nshared-trauma vignette, since clinical documen-\ntation is typically organized at the single-patient\nrecord level, and our framework assumes one pa-\ntient per record.\n3.4\nSemantic Graph Conversion\nWe convert each narrative X into a semantic graph\nG, in which clinical entities are represented as\nnodes and inter-entity relations as typed edges\nvia E. The conversion operator E is a schema-\nconstrained, LLM-assisted module that maps a free-\ntext psychiatric narrative into a structured semantic\ngraph by identifying clinical entities, temporal at-\ntributes, and typed relations. The resulting graph\nserves as the standardized intermediate represen-\ntation for perturbation and graph-conditioned text\ngeneration.\nConversion pipeline.\nThe semantic graph is con-\nstructed through a staged, schema-constrained con-\nRaw Clinical Narrative\nDe-identified Narrative\nConversion\nDISORDER\nTREATMENT\nSYMPTOM #1\nSYMPTOM #2\nPerturbed Semantic Graph\nDISORDER\nTREATMENT\nSYMPTOM #1\nSYMPTOM #2\nPerturbation\nGeneration \nEpisodes: CHANGED \nStructure: PRESERVED\nSemantic Graph\nFigure 2: Overview of the Anonpsy pipeline for de-\nidentification of psychiatric narratives via structure-\npreserving generation.

The pipeline proceeds in four stages: (1)\nschema-guided identification of clinical entities and\ncase-level attributes using constrained LLM decod-\ning; (2) construction and normalization of temporal\nepisodes anchored to the index encounter; (3) deter-\nministic reconciliation and canonicalization of tem-\nporal intervals to enforce one-to-one node–episode\ncorrespondence; and (4) construction of typed inter-\nentity relations under fixed clinical and schema\nconstraints. This staged design separates semantic\ninference from temporal and structural normaliza-\ntion, enabling intermediate validation and limiting\nerror propagation.\nSemantic graph definition.\nNode types.\nWe instantiate nodes for diag-\nnoses, symptoms, treatments, past history, and\na structured VisitEvent. The VisitEvent node\nrepresents the most recent clinical encounter and\nanchors all temporal offsets; it encodes setting, ar-\nrival mode, and safety-relevant context, and links\nto currently active symptoms via PRESENTS_WITH\nedges. Symptom episodes are decomposed using\na modular Situation-Thought-Emotion-Behavior\n(STEB) schema, derived from the cognitive model\nof psychopathology, which isolates manipulable\ncontextual elements while preserving clinically\nmeaningful structure (Beck, 1979).\nTemporal representation.\nEach event is an-\nchored to a pool of duration objects capturing onset\noffset and span relative to an index encounter at\nday 0. Offsets before and after day 0 are encoded\nas signed integers, enabling ordering without spec-\nifying calendar dates. Nodes may reference one or\nmore durations, allowing reasoning about tempo-\nral sequence, overlap, and whether a symptom is\ncurrent or historical.\nRelation types.\nEdges encode clinically inter-\npretable dependencies, including MANIFESTS_AS\n(symptom to diagnosis), TREATMENT_OF (treatment\nto symptom or diagnosis), PRESENTS_WITH (visit\nevent to current symptoms), and INDUCES (etio-\nlogic entity to diagnosis). Permissible source-target\ntype pairs are fixed in advance to prevent unsup-\nported or spurious edges.\n3.5\nGraph-based Perturbation\nWe apply a perturbation operator P to the seman-\ntic graph G to produce a modified graph ˜G that\nreduces re-identification risk by altering identify-\ning narrative content while preserving clinically\nmeaningful structure. Perturbation is restricted to\nattribute- and context-level fields and does not mod-\nify the temporal backbone or the typed inter-entity\nrelations. As a result, temporal ordering, event\noverlap, and clinically constrained dependencies\nencoded in G are preserved by construction in ˜G.\nSpecifically, P perturbs (i) demographic at-\ntributes under clinical feasibility constraints, (ii)\nsymptom-associated contextual narratives repre-\nsented in the STEB schema while preserving di-\nagnostic meaning and temporal anchors, and (iii)\nnumeric test-result values through range-preserving\nsubstitution that maintains clinical interpretation.\n3.6\nGraph-conditioned Text Generation\nA graph-conditioned text generation operator D\nproduces a de-identified narrative ˆX conditioned\non the perturbed graph ˜G. Events are sorted by\ntemporal anchor and associated diagnoses, grouped\ninto clinically meaningful episodes, and serialized\ninto a narrative outline. The model is prompted to\npreserve causal dependencies, avoid hallucinated\nclinical details, and maintain stylistic coherence.\nBecause the generation process is conditioned on\n˜G, the resulting narrative ˆX preserves the clinical\nstructure of the original while replacing identifying\ncontextual content.\n4\nExperiments\nWe evaluate Anonpsy in terms of the two objectives\nintroduced in Section 3.1: (1) clinical structure\npreservation and (2) de-identification robustness.\nBecause psychiatric diagnosis depends on tempo-\nral course, symptom configuration, and causal rela-\ntions, distortions to diagnostically essential struc-\nture should manifest as shifts in downstream di-\nagnostic judgments; we therefore use diagnosis\npreservation as a functional proxy for clinical struc-\nture preservation.\nIn addition to expert and GPT-5 evaluations, we\nquantify a deterministic proxy for narrative recalla-\nbility using embedding-based semantic cosine sim-\nilarity between each original narrative and its de-\nidentified variant. Methods that leave idiosyncratic\nlife events and narrative content largely intact re-\nmain closer in embedding space due to higher se-\nmantic overlap, whereas stronger contextual pertur-\nbation yields lower similarity.

Differences across\nnarrative types were analyzed using a linear mixed-\neffects model with random intercepts for case and\nrater, treating Anonpsy as the reference condition.\nQ2 responses were analyzed using a Bayesian lo-\ngistic mixed-effects model to handle strong class\nimbalance (most responses were \"yes\").\nEffect\nβ\nSE\np\nIntercept (Anonpsy)\n0.719\n0.053\n<.001\nLLM-only vs. Anonpsy\n0.024\n0.062\n0.699\nOriginal vs. Anonpsy\n0.005\n0.062\n0.932\nTable 1:\nMixed-effects model for Q1 soft-F1\nscores.

The vast majority of Anonpsy\nratings fell in the \"no or minimal risk\" range\n(scores 1–2), with a median of 1. Importantly, no\nAnonpsy narrative received a score above 3,\nand no case showed majority agreement among\nraters that the Anonpsy output was at moderate\nrisk (score ≥3). Only one case received a score\nof 3 by two raters.\nIn contrast, LLM-only rewrites exhibited a sub-\nstantially heavier upper tail of risk scores. The\nmean paired risk score was 2.800 for LLM-only ver-\nsus 1.540 for Anonpsy and median risk score was\n3.000 and 1.000, respectively. A Wilcoxon signed-\nrank test confirmed the difference was highly sig-\nnificant (W = 84.5, p < 0.001), showing that\nLLM-only outputs were systematically rated as\nhigher risk when evaluated on the same underlying\ncase by the same psychiatrist (Table 3).\nWhen a version was chosen as more similar to\nthe original, its mean risk score was 3.122 for LLM-\nonly (n = 41) versus 2.111 for Anonpsy (n = 9),\ndemonstrating a significant statistical difference\n(Mann–Whitney U = 280.0, p = 0.012).

In the only case where two raters\ngave a score of 3, both explained that their judg-\nment was driven by the presence of a rare diagnosis\n(Lyme disease), noting that clinicians often refer\nto such cases by the rare diagnosis itself, making\nthe case feel recognizable regardless of narrative\ncontent. Raters emphasized that the rewritten text\ndid not preserve distinctive events, quotations, or\nlocations.\nIn the remaining instances, raters who judged\nAnonpsy as more similar than LLM-only at-\ntributed this to preserved clinical similarity: shared\nsymptom themes, developmental patterns, or\nbroadly similar demographic information, which\nthe pipeline intentionally maintains. Comments\nnoted that the narratives were \"not specific enough\nto identify an individual,\" that similarity arose\nfrom \"general clinical patterns rather than details,\"\nand that \"despite coherence, it does not feel like\nthe same person.\" No rater ever identified an un-\nchanged concrete anchor such as exact date, loca-\ntion, or unique event in an Anonpsy output. For\na concrete illustrative example, including a case-\nlevel comparison of the Original, LLM-only, and\nAnonpsy outputs and representative evaluator com-\nments, see Appendix D.4.\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Interpretation.\nTaken together, these findings\nshow that Anonpsy achieves very low face-value\nre-identification risk. Ratings were strongly con-\ncentrated at 1–2, no case drew majority agreement\nfor moderate risk, and no output exceeded a score\nof 3. Moderate ratings were driven by rare clinical\nfeatures of the original case rather than preserva-\ntion of narrative content. In contrast, LLM-only\nrewrites were frequently judged as similar to the\noriginal story and received substantially higher re-\nidentification scores. Thus, Anonpsy successfully\nsuppresses recognizable narrative identity while re-\ntaining the clinical information necessary for down-\nstream reasoning.\n4.2\nAutomated GPT-5 Evaluation\nTo verify that the human-evaluated patterns gener-\nalize across the full corpus, we conducted a par-\nallel GPT-5-based evaluation on all 90 DSM-5-\nTR cases. GPT-5 was used both as a diagnostic\nreasoner and as a proxy for a knowledgeable in-\nsider. In both tasks, diagnosis prediction, and diag-\nnosis acceptability, GPT-5 showed no significant\ndifferences between Anonpsy, the original narra-\ntives, and the LLM-only baseline after DSM-aware\ncanonicalization, mirroring the human findings that\nAnonpsy preserves diagnostic structure. For de-\nidentification robustness, embedding-based seman-\ntic similarity and a GPT-5 insider simulation both\nfavored Anonpsy: its narratives were significantly\nmore semantically distant from the originals and\nreceived lower re-identification risk scores than\nLLM-only rewrites (Tables 9 and 10). Full canoni-\ncalization rules, statistical tests, and detailed results\nare provided in Appendix D.5, D.6\n4.3\nSummary\nAcross both human and automated evaluations,\nAnonpsy achieves the intended combination of\nclinical structure preservation and strong de-\nidentification robustness. Human psychiatrists\nand GPT-5 concur that Anonpsy narratives sup-\nport DSM-5-TR diagnostic reasoning as well as the\noriginal text and a strong LLM-only baseline, yet\nare substantially less similar to and less recallable\nas the original patient. The LLM-only baseline\npreserves clinical information but insufficiently al-\nters narrative identity, whereas Anonpsy introduces\ncontrolled, structure-aware transformations that sig-\nnificantly reduce re-identification risk without com-\npromising downstream clinical utility.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present Anonpsy, a graph-based framework for\nde-identifying psychiatric case histories by treat-\ning the task as a structure-preserving generation\nproblem.\nBy converting psychiatric narratives\ninto semantic graphs, applying graph-constrained\nperturbations, and regenerating narratives through\ngraph-conditioned text generation, our approach\npreserves the clinical structure necessary for down-\nstream reasoning while substantially reducing re-\nidentification risk.\nExperiments using human\nexpert judgments and GPT-5 evaluations show\nthat Anonpsy achieves consistently minimal re-\nidentification risk, with risk scores concentrated\nat the lowest end of the evaluation scale, while\nyielding markedly lower semantic similarity and\nidentifiability than strong LLM-only rewriting base-\nlines. At the same time, clinical structure is pre-\nserved: both psychiatrist and GPT-5 evaluations de-\ntect no statistically significant degradation in clin-\nical reasoning or diagnosis recoverability relative\nto the original narratives. Although instantiated for\npsychiatric narratives, the underlying paradigm of\ngraph-based, structure-preserving de-identification\nmay generalize to other clinical domains where\nidentity is encoded through event content rather\nthan explicit lexical markers.\n6\nLimitations\nAlthough\nAnonpsy\ndemonstrates\nstrong\nde-\nidentification robustness while preserving clinical\nstructure, several limitations remain. First, our\nevaluation relies on DSM-5-TR Clinical Cases, a\ncurated educational corpus with coherent narrative\nflow and fully specified diagnostic labels. Real-\nworld psychiatric documentation is more hetero-\ngeneous, varies in completeness and writing style,\nwhich poses challenges for both semantic graph\nconversion and context-aware perturbation.\nSecond, the human expert evaluation covers 20\ncases due to the specialized expertise required. Al-\nthough automated GPT-5-based evaluation on all\n90 cases shows consistent trends, broader studies\ninvolving more clinicians and more diverse datasets\nwould further strengthen generalizability.\nFinally, while Anonpsy substantially reduces re-\nidentification risk, residual risk may persist for\ncases involving rare diagnoses or highly distinc-\ntive symptom profiles, and de-identified narratives\nshould not be treated as risk-free substitutes for\nreal clinical records without additional safeguards.\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "References\nSandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Jason Ai, Sam Alt-\nman, Andy Applebaum, Edwin Arbus, Rahul K\nArora, Yu Bai, Bowen Baker, Haiming Bao, and 1\nothers. 2025. gpt-oss-120b & gpt-oss-20b model\ncard. arXiv preprint arXiv:2508.10925.\nKiana Aghakasiri, Noopur Zambare, JoAnn Thai, Car-\nrie Ye, Mayur Mehta, J Ross Mitchell, and Mohamed\nAbdalla. 2025.

If a de-\nidentification method leaves idiosyncratic narrative\ncontent largely intact, the resulting variant will ex-\nhibit higher cosine similarity to the original due to\ngreater semantic overlap. Conversely, methods that\nsubstantially perturb personal narrative content are\nexpected to yield lower cosine similarity, reflecting\nreduced narrative recallability.

Rather than relying on\na single end-to-end extraction step, the conversion\nprocess is decomposed into four conceptual stages:\n(1) schema-constrained clinical entity extraction,\n(2) temporal episode construction and normaliza-\ntion, (3) temporal reconciliation and node canoni-\ncalization, and (4) typed relation construction and\ngraph finalization. LLMs are employed for schema-\nguided extraction and constrained semantic infer-\nence, while temporal normalization, reconciliation,\nand consistency checks are implemented determin-\nistically. This staged organization enables interme-\ndiate validation, enforces schema constraints, and\nlimits error propagation across components.\nSchema-constrained clinical entity extraction.\nClinical entities are first identified under explicit\nschema constraints. Global attributes that do not\nparticipate in relational structure are extracted at\nthe case level, including demographics (age, sex,\nethnicity, occupation, and family structure), fam-\nily history, and objective test results. Test results\nare organized into four case-level fields: labs,\nimaging, mental_status, and other. Laboratory\nand imaging results are stored as semi-structured\nsummaries, while the mental status examination is\npreserved as a single near-verbatim string to avoid\nover-fragmentation of clinically cohesive observa-\ntions; remaining objective assessments such as psy-\nchiatric scales or physical examination findings are\ngrouped under other.\nCore graph nodes are then instantiated. Diagno-\nsis nodes are created directly from diagnostic meta-\ndata provided in the input data. Symptom nodes\nare extracted as DSM-aligned headwords with near-\nverbatim evidence_text and are provisionally\naligned to diagnoses under constrained decoding.\nContextual descriptors associated with each symp-\ntom are decomposed using the STEB schema, with\neach field restricted to patient-attributable narrative\ncontent rather than clinician interpretation or test\ndata. An initial current_symptom flag is assigned\nat this stage and later recomputed deterministically.\nTreatment nodes are extracted with schema-limited\nattributes (type, name, dose, route, frequency, and\noutcome), with route values normalized to a con-\ntrolled vocabulary and populated only for admin-\nistrable interventions. A single VisitEvent node\nis instantiated to represent the index encounter, en-\ncoding setting, arrival mode, legal status, reason for\nvisit, safety flags, and source of information, along\nwith a short near-verbatim visit_episode anchor-\ning the presentation narrative. Past-history nodes\nare created from explicit past-history mentions and\ndiagnoses marked as pre-existing or remitted.\nTemporal episode construction and normaliza-\ntion.\nFor each symptom, treatment, and past-\nhistory item, one or more temporal episodes rel-\native to the index encounter (day 0) are extracted.\nEpisodes are initially represented as (offset, span,\nunit) triples with an optional ongoing flag. When\nexplicit temporal expressions are present, they are\nparsed directly; when timing is coarse or implicit,\nsuch as \"for several years,\" \"in childhood,\" or \"re-\ncently,\" expressions are mapped to the coarsest\ncompatible offset and span supported by the text.\nIf no explicit temporal expression is provided, a\nconstrained, order-preserving inference is applied:\nrelative position within the narrative and relations\nto other temporally grounded events are used to as-\nsign a plausible relative offset, without introducing\nabsolute dates or fine-grained spans. This inference\nis conservative and respects narrative order; when\ninsufficient evidence exists to localize an event be-\nyond ordering, temporal boundaries are left under-\nspecified.\nWhen an episode is ongoing or lacks an explicit\nend, a finite span is deterministically assigned us-\ning a shared timeline horizon derived from other\nepisodes. All episodes are then canonicalized into a\nunified day-based coordinate system, yielding half-\nopen intervals [start, end) with start = offset\nand end = offset + span. Episode signatures\nare globally deduplicated by exact match on their\nday-based representation.\nTemporal reconciliation and node canonicaliza-\ntion.\nAfter global deduplication, overlapping or\nadjacent intervals referenced by the same node are\nreconciled and merged into disjoint blocks. This\nreconciliation is implemented by creating node-\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "specific virtual duration objects and rewriting each\nnode’s duration_ids to reference the merged in-\ntervals; the process is iterated until a fixed point is\nreached, and unreferenced durations are removed.\nThe current_symptom flag is then recomputed de-\nterministically: a symptom is labeled current if any\nreconciled interval covers day 0 under the half-open\ninterval rule. To enforce a one-to-one correspon-\ndence between symptom nodes and temporal inter-\nvals, symptoms associated with multiple distinct\nepisodes are split into one-episode-per-node rep-\nresentations, with contextual STEB frames paired\nto episodes by temporal order. This stage fixes the\ntemporal backbone of the graph and canonically\ndefines node identity.\nB.1.2\nTyped relation construction and graph\nfinalization.\nOnce node inventories and temporal structure are\nfixed, typed inter-entity relations are constructed\nusing a combination of deterministic rules and\nconstrained model-based selection.\nThese in-\nclude diagnostic links (MANIFESTS_AS), therapeu-\ntic links (TREATMENT_OF) to diagnoses or past-\nhistory targets, and visit-level presentation links\n(PRESENTS_WITH) from the VisitEvent node to\nall symptoms whose reconciled temporal intervals\ncover day 0.\nEtiologic relations (INDUCES) are added conser-\nvatively in two steps. First, diagnosis labels con-\ntaining explicit etiologic morphology (e.g., \"due\nto,\" \"-induced\") are parsed and linked to the most\nappropriate anchor. Second, an additional con-\nstrained LLM-based causal pass introduces fur-\nther INDUCES edges only when explicit causal state-\nments are supported by near-verbatim textual evi-\ndence.\nAfter all stages, the graph undergoes final consis-\ntency checks and is serialized into a stable YAML\nrepresentation consisting of typed nodes, typed\nrelations, and a shared pool of normalized dura-\ntion objects. This semantic graph serves as the\nsole input to downstream perturbation and graph-\nconditioned text generation.\nB.1.3\nFormal semantic graph schema\nThis section describes the structure of the seman-\ntic graph produced during conversion from free-\ntext psychiatric narratives. The representation is\ndesigned to make clinically meaningful structure\nexplicit while supporting targeted perturbation of\nidentifying content. An overview of the formal\nsemantic graph schema is shown in Table 4.\nSymptom context representation (STEB)\nEach\nsymptom node contains one or more contextual\nframes decomposed into the STEB schema:\n• Situation: an external or observable context.\n• Thought: the patient’s internal appraisal or\ninterpretation of the situation.\n• Emotion: the affective state associated with\nthe situation.\n• Behavior: the observable behavioral response\nto the situation.\nThe STEB schema serves as a modular scaffold\nthat isolates manipulable narrative components\nwhile preserving clinically meaningful structure.\nTo ensure that this decomposition is psychiatrically\ngrounded and supports controlled perturbation, the\nschema is informed by the cognitive formulation\nframework commonly used in cognitive-behavioral\ntherapy (Beck, 1979).\nTemporal representation\nTemporal information\nis encoded via a shared pool of duration objects\nreferenced by node identifiers. Each duration rep-\nresents a half-open interval [start, end) in integer\ndays relative to the index encounter (day 0), where\nnegative offsets denote pre-encounter episodes and\npositive offsets denote post-encounter episodes.\nEach symptom node references exactly one rec-\nonciled duration object. A symptom is labeled\ncurrent_symptom if its associated interval covers\nday 0 under the half-open rule.\nIllustrative serialization example\nThe semantic\ngraph is serialized to a transparent YAML format.\nThe following synthetic example illustrates how a\nsingle symptom node is represented, including its\nSTEB context and associated temporal reference.\n- id: s_003\nsymptom: ideas of reference\npattern: continuous\ncurrent_symptom: true\nevidence_text: the news announcers\nbegan to comment indirectly and\ncritically\nabout him.\ncontexts:\n- situation: while watching a\nlate -night news program\n- thought: the news announcers were\ncommenting indirectly and\ncritically about me.\n- emotion: anxious\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "Component\nYAML key\nDescription\nCase-level attributes\ndemographics\nAge, sex, ethnicity, occupation.\ntest_results\nObjective\nfindings\ngrouped\nunder\nlabs,\nimaging,\nmental_status, other.\nfamily_history\nFamily-history entries with member, condition, and support-\ning evidence text.\nGraph nodes\ndiagnoses\nDSM-5-TR diagnoses associated with the case.\nsymptoms\nDSM-aligned symptom headwords, each associated with one\nor more duration-based episodes in STEB schema.\ntreatments\nMedications, psychotherapies, or procedures, represented\nwith attributes such as name, dose, route, frequency, and\noutcome.\npast_history\nPrior psychiatric or medical conditions, including chronic\nand remitted states.\nvisit_event\nA single node representing the index clinical encounter, en-\ncoding setting, arrival mode, legal status, reason for visit,\nsafety flags, and source of information.\nTemporal objects\ndurations\nShared pool of normalized intervals (offset, span, unit)\nin days relative to day 0.\nTyped relations\nMANIFESTS_AS\nLinks a symptom to an associated diagnosis.\nTREATMENT_OF\nLinks a treatment to its diagnostic target.\nPRESENTS_WITH\nLinks the VisitEvent node to symptoms active at day 0.\nINDUCES\nEncodes etiologic relationships between entities when ex-\nplicit causal structure is present.\nTable 4: Schema overview of the semantic graph.

Age is modified through a bounded off-\nset procedure that adjusts all age-referenced dura-\ntions consistently and enforces DSM-5-TR feasibil-\nity rules for both present age and age of onset. For\nexample, antisocial personality disorder requires\nage ≥18 and neurodevelopmental disorders re-\nquire childhood onset. Sex is perturbed using a\nweighted-random scheme with hard constraints for\nsex-specific diagnoses or labels. Ethnicity and oc-\ncupation are rewritten through LLM prompts that\ngenerate plausible but non-identifying alternatives\nwhile maintaining functional realism; for exam-\nple, we restrict job types for minors and preserve\nsupport-level requirements in neurodevelopmental\ndisorders. These perturbed demographic attributes\npropagate to the graph-conditioned text generation\nmodule but do not affect the graph’s relational struc-\nture, as demographic fields do not participate in\ntyped edges.\nB.2.2\nSymptom-context perturbation.\nNarrative perturbation operates in two stages:\nrewriting the visit-event episode and then perturb-\ning the contextual descriptors associated with each\nsymptom node. Both stages preserve the clinical\nstructure encoded in the graph.\nVisit-event\nrewriting.\nFrom\nthe\nstructured\nvisit_event fields, we derive a fixed scaffold\ncapturing the core clinical attributes of the pre-\nsentation—voluntary versus involuntary status, ar-\nrival mode, clinical setting, and urgency inferred\nfrom safety flags.\nThese attributes are treated\nas immutable constraints. The LLM must gener-\nate a rewritten visit-episode narrative that remains\nfully compatible with this scaffold, ensuring that\nclinically defining properties do not change. In\nother words, a voluntary outpatient visit accom-\npanied by family cannot become an involuntary\npolice-escorted emergency arrival. Within these\nconstraints, the LLM freely rewrites the narrative\ndetails surrounding the presentation and removes\nidentifying elements such as names, locations, ad-\ndresses, and specific dates. A secondary pass op-\ntionally rewrites the concise pathway field when\nthe original phrasing is overly specific.\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "Symptom-context rewriting.\nEach symptom\nnode contains one or more contextual descriptions\nin the STEB schema. Only the STEB fields present\nin the original node are rewritten; no new fields\nare introduced. For each context, an LLM gener-\nates a replacement that preserves the symptom’s\nclinical meaning while substituting identifying psy-\nchosocial details with non-specific or semantically\nanalogous alternatives. Temporal offsets, duration\nreferences, node identifiers, and diagnostic asso-\nciations remain unchanged. Rewrites incorporate\nthe patient’s age at the event, computed from du-\nration offsets and the perturbed demographics, to\nmaintain developmental and clinical plausibility.\nAll symptom contexts are perturbed in a chrono-\nlogically retrograde order. This ensures that the\nrewritten visit episode anchors the most recent clin-\nical scenes, and each successively earlier symp-\ntom context is rewritten with access to a short win-\ndow of the already edited contexts. This retrograde\nschedule improves narrative coherence by allowing\nlater, clinically salient events—such as the circum-\nstances of presentation and current symptomatol-\nogy—to shape the rewrites of earlier episodes with-\nout introducing forward-looking inconsistencies.\nAfter each rewrite, a similarity filter rejects outputs\nthat are too close to the original text, triggering\ncontrolled LLM retries.\nTogether, the scaffold-constrained visit-event\nrewrite and STEB-based symptom-context pertur-\nbations produce a coherent yet privacy-preserving\nnarrative that preserves clinical content while re-\nmoving or altering potentially identifying contex-\ntual details.\nB.2.3\nTest-results perturbation.\nIn addition to demographic and symptom-context\nediting, we perturb numeric test results appear-\ning in the test_results fields of the YAML file.\nWe extract numeric values from free-text test sum-\nmaries and map each extracted entry to a canonical\ntest name drawn from a curated inventory (for ex-\nample, Full Scale IQ, MMSE, or fasting glucose).\nEach canonical test is associated with clinically\nmeaningful value pools representing ranges that\npreserve interpretability. The system identifies the\npool containing the original value and resamples\na new value from within the same pool, ensuring\nthat the rewritten test remains clinically equiva-\nlent while eliminating exact numeric matches that\ncould serve as linkage identifiers. The substitu-\ntion is performed minimally within the text, main-\ntaining surrounding phrasing and narrative context.\nBecause only numeric values are altered and the\nclinical category of each test remains unchanged,\nthis procedure reduces re-identification risk while\npreserving all downstream diagnostic implications.\nMental Status Examination test results.\nThe\nMental Status Examination (MSE) may contain de-\nscriptors that implicitly depend on demographics or\non themes expressed in symptom thoughts. Follow-\ning demographic and symptom-context perturba-\ntion, we therefore apply a targeted alignment. The\nmodule compares the pre- and post-perturbation\nessence objects to detect changes in age, sex, eth-\nnicity, occupation, or visit-episode framing, and\ncollects a small set of rewritten symptom thoughts\nto capture the updated thematic landscape. A con-\nstrained LLM prompt then produces a minimally\nedited MSE paragraph that harmonizes these fields,\nadjusting only those phrases that depend on demo-\ngraphic or thematic consistency while preserving\nall objective findings related to appearance, speech,\nmood and affect, thought process and content, per-\nception, orientation, insight, and judgment. The\neditor is not permitted to introduce new symptoms\nor delete clinically relevant features. This align-\nment step ensures that the perturbed case history\nremains narratively coherent and clinically faithful\nin its final form.\nB.2.4\nStructural and temporal consistency\nenforcement.\nFollowing attribute perturbation, the system re-\nvalidates graph consistency. Temporal constraints,\nincluding duration spans, onset offsets, and episode\noverlaps, are inherited unchanged from G; per-\nturbations are not permitted to alter the temporal\nbackbone. Similarly, relational constraints are pre-\nserved: if a treatment targeted a specific symptom\nor diagnosis in G, the same TREATMENT_OF edge\nmust remain valid in ˜G, and all node-type pairings\nremain schema-authorized. A consistency checker\nverifies that\nTemporal(vi, vj; G) = Temporal(vi, vj; ˜G)\nfor all clinically constrained event pairs, and that\nperturbations do not introduce contradictory or un-\nsupported causal or diagnostic relations.\nThis graph-based perturbation procedure ensures\nthat re-identification risks are reduced while main-\ntaining the clinical logic, symptom trajectory, and\nrelational structure of the original case.\n"}, {"page": 15, "text": "B.3\nGraph-conditioned Text Generation\nB.3.1\nOverview.\nGiven a perturbed semantic graph ˜G, the graph-\nto-text operator D constructs a de-identified case\nhistory in three stages: (1) a lead paragraph de-\nscribing the index presentation; (2) a deterministic\nchronological history of present illness built from\ngraph structure; and (3) a short appendix that sum-\nmarizes remaining past history, family history, and\nday 0 test results.\nB.3.2\nLead paragraph generation.\nThe first step produces a short lead paragraph that\nintroduces the patient and the index encounter. We\ncondition a ChatOllama instance (gpt-oss:120b,\ntemperature 0.1) on a compact JSON summary con-\ntaining age, sex, care setting, arrival mode, reason\nfor visit, pathway, source of history, and a brief\nvisit-episode description. The system prompt in-\nstructs the model to write two to five sentences\nin third-person past tense, covering who, where,\nand why, and explicitly forbids identifiers such as\nnames or addresses. The model returns only the\nparagraph, which is post-processed to strip meta-\ntext.\nB.3.3\nChronological history from the graph.\nThe second stage builds a deterministic, graph-\ndriven history. We first derive durations (with day\noffsets and spans), the mapping from each symp-\ntom and treatment to its duration episodes, diagno-\nsis labels, and the various relation-type maps. Dura-\ntions are sorted by offset_days to define a global\ntimeline from earliest to latest event. A helper\nconverts each offset into a human-readable time\nphrase such as “two weeks before admission” or\n“the day after admission,” with the lexicon switch-\ning automatically between “before/after admission”\nand “earlier/later” depending on whether the case\ncontains clear admission-type events.\nFor each duration block, we group symptoms\nby their linked diagnosis and generate micro-\nparagraphs per (duration, diagnosis) pair. The gen-\nerator walks through:\n1. Symptom narration.\nFor each symptom,\nwe retrieve its STEB context and construct\na single sentence that blends the time phrase\nwith situation, thought, emotion, and behavior.\nWe first call a one-sentence prompt that asks\nthe model to depict a concrete episode of the\nsymptom using the STEB fields (temperature\n0.2). A bookkeeping object ensures that each\n(item, duration) pair is narrated at most once.\n2. Treatment narration and co-regimens. For\neach diagnosis and duration, we attach treat-\nments that target that diagnosis and share the\nsame duration. When treatments are narrated,\nadditional co-treatments that share both dura-\ntion and target diagnosis are listed as part of\nthe same regimen sentence.\n3. INDUCES traversal. If a symptom, treat-\nment, or past-history node has an INDUCES re-\nlation to a diagnosis, we traverse that edge and\nnarrate a short cluster of induced symptoms\nand treatments anchored to the same tempo-\nral context, ensuring that etiologic chains (for\nexample, “steroid-induced psychosis”) are ex-\nplicitly represented.\nPast-history nodes are handled in a preliminary\npass: each past condition is narrated once at its\nearliest known offset if it either induces a diagno-\nsis or is linked to a treatment episode, optionally\nfollowed by sentences describing treatments for\nthat condition. Past-history nodes which are not\nlinked to any other nodes are appended later in the\n“Appending past history, family history, and tests”\nstep.\nB.3.4\nAppending past history, family history,\nand tests.\nAfter constructing the lead and chronological his-\ntory, we compute which past-history diagnoses\nhave not yet been mentioned, collect family-history\nsummaries from the case-level attributes, and ag-\ngregate day 0 test results.\nFor tests, we com-\nbine essence-level results from the labs, imaging,\nmental_status, and other fields.\nWe pass the draft narrative plus these structured\nlists to a ChatOllama prompt that appends one to\nfour sentences at the end of the case. The prompt\nexplicitly instructs the model to: (1) add a com-\npact sentence on remaining past history; (2) add a\ncompact sentence on family history; and (3) add a\nclause-dense sentence summarizing day 0 objective\ntest data.

The prompt also required the output\nto follow the same macro-structure as Anonpsy\n(lead presentation, chronological history of symp-\ntoms, concluding past history, family history, and\ntest results) to control for format as a confound.\nStage 2 applied a self-critique refinement prompt\nto the Stage-1 output, with explicit instructions to\nremove residual copied idiosyncratic events and\nto repair any privacy- or fidelity-violating content.\nThis two-stage setup yields a strong, structurally\ncontrolled LLM-only baseline.

Raters were\ntold that the task was to evaluate the clinical valid-\nity of synthetic psychiatric case histories; they were\nnot informed that multiple versions of the same un-\nderlying case existed. For each narrative, raters\nanswered Q1 (open-ended DSM-5-TR diagnosis)\nand Q2 (binary diagnosis-narrative congruence).\nQ1 responses were normalized by lowercasing\nand whitespace normalization but otherwise pre-\nserved DSM surface forms, including specifiers,\nto test whether fine-grained diagnostic cues were\nretained. Because each of the five psychiatrists\nevaluated the same 10 cases, the resulting 150 ob-\nservations exhibit two structured dependencies: (1)\ncase difficulty, where all raters tend to score some\ncases higher or lower depending on their inherent\ndiagnostic complexity; and (2) rater diagnostic\nstyle, reflecting stable individual tendencies such\nas stricter or more lenient thresholds for comor-\nbid diagnoses. To account for these hierarchical\ndependencies, we fit a linear mixed-effects model,\nsoft_F1 ∼C(input_type)+(1 | case)+(1 | rater),\ntreating Anonpsy as the reference level. This ap-\nproach allows the analysis to use all observations\nwhile correctly attributing variance to case-level\nand rater-level effects rather than confounding them\nwith the fixed effect of interest (input type). As a\nnon-parametric complement, we also computed\nper-(case,input) means and conducted Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank tests (Table 1 in the main text).\nFor Q2 (narrative–diagnosis congruence), re-\nsponses were binary and strongly imbalanced (90-\n96% \"yes\" across conditions). Under such imbal-\nance, classical logistic mixed-effects models can\nproduce unstable maximum-likelihood estimates.\nWe therefore fit a Bayesian logistic mixed-effects\nmodel,\nlogit P(Q2_yes = 1) ∼C(input_type)+(1 | case)+(1 | rater),\nwith variance components for both case and rater.\nThe Bayesian formulation yields stable posterior\ndistributions and transparent uncertainty estimates\nfor the effect of narrative type after adjusting for\ncase difficulty and rater-specific response patterns.\nD.3\nHuman Re-identification Study Protocol\nand Rubric\nFor the human re-identification experiment, each\npsychiatrist rated a disjoint set of 10 cases. For\neach case, they first read the original narrative, then\nan A/B pair of de-identified versions in randomized\norder, label concealed. Raters (i) selected which\nversion felt more similar to the original and (ii) as-\nsigned 1–5 re-identification risk scores to both A\nand B using a structured rubric. The rubric, sum-\nmarized in Table 6, distinguishes narratives that\nshare only generic clinical features and are not re-\nalistically recallable (scores 1–2) from narratives\nthat a knowledgeable insider could plausibly link\nback to a specific individual (scores ≥3), based on\ndistinctive narrative overlap and concrete anchors\nsuch as rare events, precise location or dates, or\ntightly characteristic life stories. This design yields\npaired risk scores for each method under a shared\ncase and rater, controlling for case difficulty and\nindividual rater stringency. We applied a two-sided\nWilcoxon signed-rank test to the paired risk scores\nand a binomial test to the proportion of times LLM-\nonly was chosen as more similar to the original. As\ndescriptive supplements, we compared risk scores\nseparately for chosen versus non-chosen versions\nusing Mann–Whitney U tests and visualized full\nscore distributions with violin plots (Figure 3).\nD.4\nQualitative Analysis: Narrative-Level\nComparison\nTo complement the quantitative re-identification\nanalysis, we present two illustrative cases from\nthe human re-identification study.

The first case exemplifies a setting\nin which Anonpsy substantially reduces narrative\nidentifiability while preserving psychiatric struc-\nture. The second illustrates a challenging failure\nmode in which both approaches exhibit residual\nrecallability, albeit for different reasons.\nIn the first case, all five psychiatrists who evalu-\nated the narratives judged the LLM-only version as\nmore recallable and at higher re-identification risk\nthan the corresponding Anonpsy output. Although\nexplicit identifiers were removed, evaluators noted\nthat the LLM-only output closely mirrored the orig-\ninal case trajectory. Comments emphasized sub-\nstantial overlap in treatment course and symptom\nprogression, including the sequence of antidepres-\nsant non-response followed by clomipramine aug-\nmentation, concurrent hypertension treated with\npropranolol, specific medication dosages, and the\nemergence of sexual dysfunction as a treatment\nside effect. One rater commented that the narrative\n\"felt largely overlapping\" (risk score 4), while an-\nother noted that \"the course and symptom pattern\nare described in a very similar way\" (risk score 4),\ncharacterizing the text as \"more of a paraphrase\"\n(risk score 3).\nThis overlap was evident in passages such as\nthe LLM-only description of treatment response:\n\"After about five weeks of this regimen the patient\nreported substantial improvement ...however, de-\nspite this renewed desire, he experienced repeated\nunsuccessful attempts at intercourse.\" Evaluators\nreported that such phrasing closely tracked the orig-\ninal narrative’s structure and sequencing, contribut-\ning to recallability.\nIn contrast, the Anonpsy output retained the clin-\nically essential structure of the case—recurrent ma-\njor depressive disorder, severe psychomotor retar-\ndation, pharmacologic non-response, subsequent\nimprovement, and treatment-emergent sexual dys-\nfunction—while substantially altering its narrative\nrealization. Demographic attributes, occupational\ncontext, and presentation framing were changed,\nand symptom severity was conveyed through em-\nbodied behavioral observations rather than repli-\ncating the original symptom listing. For exam-\nple, sexual dysfunction was preserved as a clini-\ncally relevant outcome but embedded in a distinct\nemotional and interpersonal context, as illustrated\nby phrasing such as \"he expressed fear that the\nproblem might be permanent, avoiding eye con-\ntact and repeatedly voicing shame,\" rather than a\nmedication-centered side-effect report. Evaluators\nconsistently reported that any perceived similarity\nin the Anonpsy narrative arose from generic psy-\nchiatric patterns rather than distinctive narrative\nanchors, noting that the case was \"coherent but not\nrecognizable as the same person.\"\nThe second case represents a challenging sce-\nnario involving chronic obsessive-compulsive dis-\norder dominated by contamination obsessions and\nextensive cleaning rituals. In this case, psychia-\ntrists reported that both Anonpsy and the LLM-only\nbaseline evoked the original patient, indicating a\nshared failure mode. However, evaluators empha-\nsized that the mechanisms of residual recallability\ndiffered between the two approaches. For the LLM-\nonly version, recallability was attributed to the per-\nsistence of concrete narrative anchors, including\npandemic-related anecdotes and specific cleaning\nbehaviors such as bleach use. One rater explicitly\nnoted that \"COVID-19-related episodes and bleach\nusage appear to function as identifiable cues\"(risk\nscore 3).\nFor the Anonpsy version, by contrast, evaluators\nobserved that recognizability arose not from copied\nevents or contextual anchors, but from the preser-\nvation of a highly faithful and coherent depiction\nof psychopathology. Despite altered demographics\nand narrative framing, the temporally grounded por-\ntrayal of compulsive rituals, intrusive contamina-\ntion fears, and retained insight into their irrational-\nity remained strongly evocative. One psychiatrist\n"}, {"page": 19, "text": "commented that “the description is coherent and\nvivid, and because obsessive–compulsive symp-\ntoms dominate the narrative, the patient comes to\nmind even though the details differ” (risk score 2).\nAnother noted that “demographic features are simi-\nlar, but the clinical presentation is described differ-\nently” (risk score 2). Importantly, although these\nevaluators selected Anonpsy as relatively more re-\ncallable in this case, both assigned a risk score of 2,\ncorresponding to minimal risk under the rubric, in-\ndicating thematic overlap without sufficient detail\nto identify the individual patient.\nTaken together, these two cases clarify both the\nstrengths and the boundary conditions of Anonpsy.\nIn many settings, graph-constrained perturbation\neffectively suppresses narrative identity while pre-\nserving clinically essential temporal, causal, and di-\nagnostic structure, outperforming LLM-only rewrit-\ning that inadvertently retains illness trajectories and\ntreatment sequences. However, in disorders where\nidentity is tightly coupled to symptomatology it-\nself, such as severe obsessive–compulsive disor-\nder, reducing re-identification risk remains chal-\nlenging for both approaches. Importantly, even in\nsuch cases, the mechanisms of residual recallabil-\nity differ: LLM-only preserves concrete narrative\nanchors, whereas Anonpsy preserves a rich and\ncoherent symptom structure.\nD.5\nGPT-5 Diagnosis Prediction Accuracy\nFor diagnosis prediction, we assessed whether each\nnarrative variant enabled GPT-5 to infer the cor-\nrect DSM-5-TR diagnoses. For each case, GPT-\n5 received only the narrative and generated a di-\nagnosis list, which we evaluated using a soft-F1\nmetric based on greedy semantic matching. Be-\ncause biomedical text typically exhibits substantial\nsynonymy and surface-form variation, raw string\nmatches can incorrectly penalize predictions that\nare clinically equivalent (Kartchner et al., 2023;\nLeaman et al., 2015). In the psychiatric domain,\nthis problem is amplified: DSM-5-TR diagnostic la-\nbels contain numerous surface-level variations that\ndo not meaningfully alter the underlying disorder.\nMany labels include specifiers (e.g., in remission,\nmost recent episode depressed, with psychotic fea-\ntures) that modify course or severity but do not\nchange the base diagnosis. Furthermore, DSM-5-\nTR coding rules require substituting the specific\nsubstance, medication, or medical condition into\numbrella categories such as diagnosing sedative,\nGroup\nMean F1\nMedian\nSD\nOriginal\n0.644\n0.667\n0.333\nAnonpsy\n0.567\n0.600\n0.316\nLLM-only\n0.662\n0.667\n0.329\nStatistical Tests\nFriedman χ2\n15.174\np < 0.001\nPairwise Wilcoxon (Holm)\nAnonpsy vs. LLM-only\n0.997\nAnonpsy vs. Original\n1.000\nLLM-only vs. Original\n0.602\nTable 7: Diagnosis prediction accuracy (soft-F1) across\nthe three narrative variants.\nhypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder as alprazolam\nuse disorder. When LLM returns the umbrella\ncategory as a diagnosis, this does not necessarily\nindicate loss of clinical structure in the input nar-\nrative. To ensure a clinically meaningful and fair\ncomparison, we therefore performed canonicaliza-\ntion: including lowercasing, removal of specifiers,\nand mapping known DSM synonyms (e.g., conver-\nsion disorder and functional neurological symptom\ndisorder) to a shared canonical form. This proce-\ndure ensures that evaluation reflects true diagnostic\npreservation rather than artifacts of DSM naming\nconventions or LLM phrasing.\nD.5.1\nResults.\nTable 7 presents descriptive statistics and signifi-\ncance tests across the 90 paired cases.
