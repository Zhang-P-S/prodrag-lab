For common con-\nditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and kidney\ndisease, diet works together with comorbidities, medications, and\nsocial determinants of health (SDoH) to influence patient outcomes\n[42, 54]. While nutrition-aware assessment is universally acknowl-\nedged, existing computational efforts remain fragmented and rarely\nintegrated into end-to-end decision workflows. Population-scale\neats\nhas\nIf food Danish\npastry with fruit is\nhealthy or unhealthy\nto me and why?\nNo, because the \nfood is high in \ncalorie ... \nNeed\nprotein-rich\nfood\nFigure 1: An Overview of GLEN-Bench. Our framework\nbrings scattered nutrition and health signals together into\none pipeline for nutritional health assessment.\ndietary and clinical resources, complemented by SDoH signals (e.g.,\naccess and affordability), offer the ingredients for nutrition-aware\nmodeling [50]. Using these signals, recent benchmarks and datasets\nhave focused on specific tasks, including food recommendation\n[79], diet logging and meal planning [38], risk prediction based on\nstructured records [78], and nutrition-related question answering\n[10, 76], which typically support comprehensive assessment in a\nsingle environment.\nHowever, turning these advances into practical, nutrition-aware\ninterventions requires an integrated view that current resources\nstill lack. In practical healthcare settings, effectively implement-\ning dietary interventions involves: (i) identifying individuals who\nare likely to benefit from dietary interventions; (ii) recommending\nfoods that are clinically appropriate and feasible within individual\nconstraints (e.g., affordability and accessibility); and (iii) offering\nlucid explanations to build trust and improve adherence. Yet these\nresources remain fragmented across modalities and task scopes,\nlimiting end-to-end evaluation under realistic clinical and socioe-\nconomic constraints. Despite progress on individual tasks, current\nbenchmarks do not support end-to-end evaluation of nutrition-\naware interventions under realistic clinical and socioeconomic con-\nstraints. First, nutritional decision-making inherently involves mul-\ntidimensional reasoning over dietary behaviors, health conditions,\nsocioeconomic factors, and food access barriers; yet prior work\noften models these dimensions in isolation (e.g., nutrient targets\narXiv:2601.18106v1  [cs.CL]  26 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nHuang et al.\nwithout feasibility constraints). Second, tasks such as food recom-\nmendation and health risk detection are usually studied in isolation,\neven though they depend on one another in real-world settings.\nThird, the field lacks a standard evaluation ’yardstick’. Fragmented\ndata sources and inconsistent metrics prevent direct comparisons\nacross methods, making it difficult to identify which approaches\nwork in real-world interventions.\nTo bridge these gaps, we introduce GLEN-Bench, the first com-\nprehensive graph-language based benchmark for nutritional health\nassessment, supporting both structured graph reasoning and natural-\nlanguage decision support. We build a disease-agnostic heteroge-\nneous graph by integrating NHANES [7], FNDDS [43], and USDA\naccess signals [58]. This structure captures essential dependencies\nbetween users, foods, and socioeconomic barriers. The schema is\nhighly scalable; it extends to conditions like diabetes or obesity\nby simply adding condition-specific requirements. Furthermore,\nGLEN-Bench centers on an interdependent task suite that reflects\nend-to-end clinical workflows. Finally, we benchmark over 20 com-\nputational approaches, spanning classical ML, graph neural net-\nworks, large language models, and hybrid architectures, to establish\na systematic baseline under a unified protocol.\nWe set up three tasks in our benchmark testing: (1) Risk Detection\nidentifies at-risk populations through dietary, social, and economic\npatterns. This not only supports population screening but also re-\nveals how the model learns signals related to nutrition and health.\n(2) Personalized Recommendation suggests foods that meet clinical\nguidelines and individual needs while remaining affordable and\naccessible. (3) Interpretable Question Answering assesses food-user\ncompatibility via nutrient-level attribution and natural language\nexplanations grounded in the knowledge graph, supporting trans-\nparent, informed decisions. These interdependent tasks form real\nclinical workflows, i.e., detection identifies intervention candidates,\nrecommendation formulates tailored suggestions, and explanation\nensures uptake. Beyond these core tasks, our design is scalable and\nnaturally supports meal planning, ingredient substitution, dietary\nadherence prediction, and food-drug interaction analysis, making\nGLEN-Bench an evolving AI platform for nutritional intelligence.\nIn summary, the main contributions are as follows:\n• First Comprehensive Multi-Task Benchmark for Nutri-\ntional Health. We introduce the first comprehensive multi-task\nbenchmark for nutritional health, which jointly evaluates risk\ndetection, personalized recommendations, and explainable in-\nterpretations. GLEN-Bench is designed as a long-term scalable\nplatform applicable to various nutrition-related diseases and sup-\nporting a wide range of downstream tasks.\n• A Novel Multi-Dimensional Nutrition–Health Graph. We\nbuilt a large-scale nutrition-health graph to capture the complex\ninner relationships between diet, health, and social factors. This\ngraph includes not only food and disease data, but also socioe-\nconomic factors such as food insecurity, poverty, and access to\nhealthcare. While previous datasets mostly focused on the asso-\nciation between nutrients and diseases, our approach provides a\nmore comprehensive perspective.\n• Systematic Evaluation Revealing Design Principles. We con-\nducted the first systematic evaluation of over 20 methods, encom-\npassing classic machine learning (ML), graph neural networks\n(GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid architectures.\nOur findings highlight the advantages of graph-based reasoning\nmethods, where approaches combining graph neural networks\nwith large language models achieved the best overall performance\nand more consistent interpretations under standardized protocols.\nWe also further revealed interpretable dietary and socioeconomic\ncharacteristics associated with health risks, providing practical\ninsights for developing effective interventions.\n2\nRelated Work\nNutritional Health Research. Current computational methods\nfor health risk assessment typically use electronic health records\n(EHRs), wearable devices, or survey data to predict chronic diseases\nand adverse health outcomes [28, 34, 69]. Some studies also analyze\nonline behavior to identify at-risk populations and lifestyle patterns\n[39, 45]. However, most of these methods focus on prediction accu-\nracy rather than providing clear explanations that can guide practi-\ncal interventions. Research in public health has consistently shown\nconnections between dietary patterns and disease risk, recovery out-\ncomes, and socioeconomic inequalities [3, 42, 54, 62]. These findings\nhave driven the development of computational tools that integrate\nnutrition and behavioral data [1, 48, 78]. Food recommendation has\nprogressed from preference-based ranking toward health-aware\npersonalization [36, 52, 57], evolving from single-metric optimiza-\ntion (e.g., calories or fat) [16, 52] to integrating nutritional standards\nand health signals [5, 53, 63, 78, 79]. Nevertheless, many systems\nstill overlook structural feasibility constraints (e.g., affordability and\nlimited access) that shape real dietary choices. Knowledge graphs\nhave been used to model food–health relationships for dietary adap-\ntation and ingredient substitution [9, 13, 14, 18], and recent KGQA\nand graph-RAG advances combine LLMs with GNNs to support\nstructured reasoning [15, 25–27, 29, 67, 77]. Despite these advances,\npersonalized services are often limited by a lack of user-specific\nmedical information and socioeconomic factors [5], and evaluation\nresults remain inconsistent due to the lack of uniform, intervention-\naligned benchmarks that reflect the end-to-end nutritional health\nworkflow.\nNutritional Health Benchmarks and Datasets. Existing nutri-\ntion and health resources cover a variety of different modalities and\ntask scenarios, including food-centric corpora, nutritional knowl-\nedge bases/ontologies, and health-oriented question-answering\ndatasets. Recipe1M+ [41] provides large-scale multimodal recipes\nfor food understanding and recommendation, while Nutrition5k\n[56] supports vision-based nutritional analysis and provides fine-\ngrained nutritional component annotation. Structured food knowl-\nedge is represented by nutrition knowledge graphs (KGs) such as\nFoodKG [18] and standardized ontologies such as FoodOn [12]. In\nterms of nutrition-related question answering, RecipeQA [72] fo-\ncuses on multimodal procedural reasoning, while other resources\nintegrate nutritional ontologies and health indicators [33, 51] to en-\nable structured food-health queries. Meanwhile, general graph rea-\nsoning and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks advance\nmulti-hop querying and structured reasoning [4, 32, 35], but re-\nmain largely generic or disconnected from clinical intervention\ncontexts [20, 37]. Recent domain-specific datasets begin connecting\ndiet and health contexts [76, 78, 79], yet they typically evaluate\nisolated tasks.

For completeness, we include additional related work in\nthe appendix E.\n3\nGLEN-Bench\n3.1\nData Sources\nGLEN-Bench integrates three population-level datasets to capture\nnutrition, health, and socioeconomic factors. From NHANES, we ex-\ntract demographics, clinical data, medical conditions, medications,\ndietary behaviors, and 24-hour food intake records, along with so-\ncioeconomic indicators like income and food security status. Using\nFNDDS/WWEIA, we map foods to nutrient profiles and standard-\nized categories, enabling nutrient-based food representations and\nthreshold-defined nutrition tags. Finally, we augment foods with\naffordability tiers using USDA Purchase-to-Plate price estimates,\nallowing models to reason about economic feasibility alongside\nclinical suitability (detailed source descriptions are provided in\nAppendix A.1).\n3.2\nGraph Construction\nWe utilized NHANES data from 2003 to 2020 to construct the GLEN\nNutritional-Health Graph, a heterogeneous graph that captures the\ninteractions between users, foods, and their clinical, behavioral,\nand socioeconomic backgrounds.\nDefinition 3.1 GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph. We model the graph\nas a directed heterogeneous graph G = (V, E, T, R), where V is\nthe set of nodes, E ⊆V × V is the set of edges, and T and R\ndenote node and relation types. Each node 𝑣∈V and edge 𝑒∈E\nis assigned a type through mappings 𝜏: V →T and 𝜑: E →R.\nNode types include user, food, ingredient, category, dietary_habit,\nhealth_condition, nutrition_tag, financial_tag, and price_tag, while\nedges are used to describe consumption, ingredient composition,\nhealth and dietary habit context, and nutrition/price constraints.\nUser Nodes. Let U = {𝑣∈V | 𝜏(𝑣) = user} and F = {𝑣∈\nV | 𝜏(𝑣) = food}. Each user node 𝑢∈U is associated with a\nfeature vector x𝑢∈R𝑑𝑢that concatenates demographic attributes\n(e.g., age, sex, race) with clinical and laboratory measurements\n(e.g., BMI, blood pressure, metabolic biomarkers) from NHANES.\nDiagnosed conditions, self-reported dietary habits, and financial\nhardship are modeled as explicit neighbors rather than entries in x𝑢:\nusers connect to health_condition, dietary_habit, and financial_tag\nnodes (e.g., poverty status and food insecurity). Together, these\nattributes and links collectively describe the medical and social\nenvironment that influences dietary behavior and vulnerability.\nFood Nodes. Each food node 𝑓\n∈F has a feature vector\nx𝑓∈R𝑑𝑓derived from FNDDS and USDA Purchase-to-Plate. From\nFNDDS and WWEIA we obtain nutrient profiles summarizing\nmacro- and micronutrients, while ingredient and category nodes\ncapture composition and hierarchical food groups; foods connect\nto these nodes via contain and belong_to edges. From Purchase-to-\nPlate we obtain price per 100 grams and discretize it into price_tag\nnodes (e.g., low_price/medium_price/high_price). Thus, each food\nis grounded by nutrient content and affordability, with additional\ncontext provided by ingredient and category neighbors.\nHealth Conditions and Nutrition Tags. Health-related di-\netary requirements are encoded by health_condition and nutri-\ntion_tag nodes. Health conditions are derived from NHANES clini-\ncal and questionnaire records and linked to users through edges.\nNutrition tags represent guideline-based threshold constraints (e.g.,\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nHuang et al.\nUser\nLow Sodium\nHypertension\nObesity\nHigh Calorie\nCake made with\nglutinous rice\nDiet Habit A\nIngredient A\nhas\nhas\nhas\ncontains\nhas\ncontradict\nmatch\ncontains\nQuestion: Based on the information provided, \nplease judge if food\nis healthy or unhealthy to the\nand why? \n<Task Specific Prompts>\nCake made with glutinous rice\nuser\nMulti-label Classification Answer:\nText Generation Answer: No, \nbecause the food is high in calorie ...\nHigh Calorie\n- ML\n- TG\nGNN\nHealthy\nActive\nRecovered\nNode\nLabel\nGLEN\nNutrition-Health\nGraph\nUser Subgraph\nGNN-based\nEncoder\n+\nLinear\nClassifier\nUser Profile\nLLM Encoder\nMLP\nClassifier\nLLM Encoder\nMLP\nClassifier\nSubgraph\nContext\nUser Food Interaction Graph\nFood Tags\nUser Tags\nUser Node\nFood Node\nNode Embeddings\nGraph based\nRecommender\nTop-K\nRecommendations\n(II) Health Risk Detection\n(I) Food Recommendation\n(III) Nutritional Question Answering\nFigure 3: Overview of the GLEN-Bench framework.

We further associate conditions with rel-\nevant tags (e.g., hypertension with low sodium) to support down-\nstream suitability assessment. Financial hardship is represented by\nfinancial_tag nodes (poverty and food insecurity) and considered\njointly with price_tag nodes when modeling economic access.\nEdges and Relations. Edges in E capture observed behavior\nand constraint structure: users link to consumed foods, conditions,\nhabits, and financial tags, while foods link to ingredients, categories,\nnutrition tags, and price tags. Together, these relations encode what\npeople eat, how foods are composed and priced, and how clini-\ncal status and socioeconomic constraints shape nutritionally ap-\npropriate and affordable options. The resulting graph integrates\ndietary behavior, health status, financial hardship, and food compo-\nsition in a single heterogeneous structure. Let XU ∈R|U|×𝑑𝑢and\nXF ∈R| F|×𝑑𝑓denote the feature matrices for user and food nodes,\nand let A denote the adjacency structure induced by E. Together,\n(G, XU, XF) provide the backbone for GLEN-Bench detection, rec-\nommendation, and question answering tasks across diverse health\nconditions. Details on feature processing and dataset statistics are\nprovided in Appendix A.\n4\nNutritional Health Applications\nThis section instantiates GLEN-Bench’s three core evaluation tasks\nand reports a standardized benchmarking study of diverse model\nfamilies. For each task, we describe the task definition, evaluation\nmetrics, baseline models and setup, and present the corresponding\nresults and analyses.\n4.1\nOpioid Misuse Detection\nWe apply GLEN-Bench to opioid use disorder (OUD), a challeng-\ning scenario where models must identify subtle nutritional and\nbehavioral differences between active use, recovery, and healthy in-\ndividuals. The opioid crisis has claimed over 500,000 U.S. lives since\n1999 [22, 23], yet nutrition-informed support remains understudied\ndespite evidence of poor diet quality and socioeconomic hardship\namong individuals with OUD [8, 11, 21, 44, 60, 68]. Accordingly, we\ninclude OUD risk detection to evaluate screening under realistic\nclinical and socioeconomic constraints.\nTask Definition. The Health Risk Detection task aims to classify\neach user node in the GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph into health-\nstatus categories based on dietary and socioeconomic signatures.\nFor our OUD instantiation, this is formulated as a three-class classi-\nfication problem: active opioid user, opioid-recovered user, or normal\nuser. Unlike binary settings, we formulate a three-class problem\nand leverage multi-relational graph context. We obtain labels from\nNHANES opioid prescription and self-report records (Appendix A).\nTo classify individuals, models must integrate information about\ntheir diet, health conditions, and socioeconomic factors. Distin-\nguishing active users from those in recovery is particularly hard,\nas both groups share similar risk factors and differ only in minor\ndietary and behavioral patterns. For all predictive models in this\ntask, we remove User–Opioid_Level edges and never expose opi-\noid_level nodes or features during training and inference, to avoid\nany label leakage.\nEvaluation Metrics. In our dataset, the three classes are highly\nimbalanced, with at-risk users being relatively rare. Therefore, we\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "GLEN-Bench: A Graph-Language based Benchmark for Nutritional Health\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nTable 1: Opioid Misuse Detection over GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph with two train-validation-test splits (60/20/20 and 70/15/15).\nLLM methods use LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nMethods\nTrain 60% – Valid 20% – Test 20%\nTrain 70% – Valid 15% – Test 15%\nF1-macro\nAUC\nGMean\nAccuracy\nF1-macro\nAUC\nGMean\nAccuracy\nMLP\n11.42±1.09\n56.08±0.36\n49.17±0.08\n17.38±0.32\n12.75±1.03\n56.95±0.22\n52.58±0.11\n18.85±0.32\nGCN[30]\n12.52±0.94\n57.01±0.31\n52.39±0.13\n18.37±2.88\n13.49±1.07\n58.41±0.36\n53.46±0.09\n20.07±0.31\nGraphSAGE[17]\n16.96±1.05\n55.63±0.15\n51.51±0.12\n28.57±0.28\n18.75±0.54\n59.62±0.14\n56.39±0.23\n32.41±1.02\nGAT[59]\n17.84±0.89\n56.70±0.25\n54.15±0.19\n33.04±2.59\n19.60±0.97\n61.52±0.28\n57.19±0.22\n33.82±0.29\nRGCN[49]\n19.22±0.51\n58.85±0.34\n54.31±0.24\n33.13±0.77\n20.56±0.13\n56.91±0.04\n50.86±0.03\n37.49±0.22\nHGT[24]\n21.63±0.74\n57.42±0.35\n50.80±0.39\n39.79±0.23\n20.80±0.89\n56.48±0.32\n52.41±0.27\n37.70±0.27\nHAN [65]\n25.85±0.06\n70.58±0.09\n65.08±0.12\n47.43±0.19\n24.25±0.09\n71.23±0.05\n65.67±0.10\n43.40±0.24\nLLaMA-3.1\n22.94±0.07\n67.99±0.19\n60.33±0.19\n42.24±0.20\n21.61±0.04\n68.21±0.15\n59.27±0.12\n38.97±0.12\nQwen3\n23.82±0.07\n67.90±0.17\n60.89±0.18\n44.73±0.29\n22.91±0.08\n69.76±0.07\n60.73±0.06\n42.84±0.27\nDeepSeek-R1\n24.86±0.03\n64.31±0.17\n56.29±0.16\n48.51±0.12\n24.11±0.11\n69.05±0.11\n60.42±0.06\n45.74±0.37\nLLaMA-3.1 + Graph\n27.99±0.14\n70.28±0.33\n61.61±0.23\n54.73±0.31\n29.28±0.10\n69.74±0.29\n60.29±0.38\n58.63±0.56\nQwen3 + Graph\n28.55±0.34\n70.57±0.37\n61.34±0.24\n55.91±0.76\n29.55±0.43\n71.31±0.42\n63.39±0.32\n59.15±1.04\nDeepSeek-R1 + Graph\n31.45±0.15\n70.74±0.37\n60.43±0.20\n67.20±0.49\n30.22±0.21\n71.97±0.33\n63.29±0.28\n60.82±0.66\nuse metrics that evaluate performance across all classes rather than\nfavoring the majority class.

We organize baseline methods into three categories\n(Table 1). (i) Non-graph baseline: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\noperating on tabular user features, which quantifies the benefit\nof explicitly modeling interactions. (ii) Graph baselines: homoge-\nneous GNNs (GCN [30], GraphSAGE [17], GAT [59]) trained on a\nsimplified homogeneous graph that ignores node/edge types (or\nconcatenates type features), enabling us to isolate the gain from con-\nnectivity alone; and heterogeneous GNNs (RGCN [49], HGT [24],\nHAN [65]) that preserve multi-relational structure via type-specific\nparameters.

We fur-\nther evaluate LLM + Graph hybrids (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 + Graph)\nby injecting graph-derived neighborhood context into prompts as\nstructured evidence. Table 1 reports F1-macro, AUC, GMean, and\nAccuracy for all baselines under both splits.\nResults Table 1 shows that graph structure is essential for iden-\ntifying at-risk users whose patterns of misuse are often latent or\n\"hidden\". Compared to non-graph MLP baseline, message passing\nmodels such as GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT significantly improve\nmacro-F1 and GMean under both splits. This shows that node fea-\ntures alone are not enough. The graph structure captures complex\nrelationships and risk patterns that cannot be detected from indi-\nvidual data points. Heterogeneous modeling further amplifies these\ngains. HAN attains the best GMean among classical GNNs in the\n70/15/15 split, indicating that separating relation types (e.g., user-to-\nhealth vs. user-to-habit) reduces feature interference and improves\nsensitivity toward minority classes. LLMs perform well on average,\nbut they struggle with class balance in highly imbalanced datasets.\nWhile their AUC values are competitive, their macro F1 and GMean\nscores lag behind the best graph models. This suggests that LLMs\nare susceptible to semantic bias from majority classes, and seman-\ntic reasoning alone cannot capture the fine-grained relational cues\nneeded for minority class detection. The hybrid approach addresses\nthis gap. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model with graph achieves\nthe best results across metrics in both splits. The improvement over\ntext-only LLMs suggests that graph structure acts as a guide, help-\ning the LLM focus on relevant neighborhood patterns and make\nmore stable predictions for rare users. The results across the two\ndataset splits show a consistent trend. Adjusting the split ratio from\n60/20/20 to 70/15/15 increased the number of training samples,\nbut the relative ranking of the models remained stable. Although\nthe accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 + Graph adjusts from 67.20±0.49 to\n60.82±0.66, its continued dominance confirms that the model cap-\ntures invariant structural properties rather than relying on specific\noverfitting. While pure LLMs improve primarily on accuracy and\nAUC with flatter macro F1 scores, the consistent gains of hybrid\napproaches across all metrics suggest that graph structure helps\nextract deeper value from additional training data.\nThese results suggest a clear strategy: use graphs to organize\nclinical information and let LLMs analyze the resulting patterns.\nGraphs capture relationships that are hard to describe in text, while\nLLMs provide flexible reasoning across different user profiles. This\napproach translates graph structure into better predictions while\nkeeping strong performance for identifying at-risk individuals.\n4.2\nPersonalized Food Recommendation\nPersonalized food recommendation is central to nutrition-aware in-\ntervention because it translates risk screening into actionable daily\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nHuang et al.\nTable 2: Personalized Food Recommendation over GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph.

In practice, recommendations must be not only preference-\naligned but also clinically appropriate under condition-specific con-\nstraints (e.g., sodium restriction for hypertension) and feasible un-\nder socioeconomic limitations such as affordability and food access.\nThese interconnected needs constitute a multi-objective scenario\nthat requires balancing relevance, health compliance, and feasibil-\nity, rather than simply optimizing user interaction. Therefore, we\ntreat personalized food recommendation as a core task to evaluate\nwhether the model can leverage the GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph\nto generate clinically and economically valuable recommendations.\nTask Definition. This task is formulated as a top-𝐾food recom-\nmendation problem where, for each user in GLEN Nutrition-Health\nGraph, the model must rank candidate foods and return a list of 𝐾\nitems that are nutritionally appropriate and economically feasible,\nwhile still matching the user’s preferences. Unlike conventional\ncollaborative filtering that relies primarily on user-item interac-\ntion patterns, our formulation leverages the rich heterogeneous\nstructure of GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph. User nodes connect\nnot only to consumed foods but also to health condition nodes\nencoding clinical diagnoses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), nutri-\ntion tag nodes specifying dietary requirements (e.g., low_sodium,\nhigh_fiber), and socioeconomic indicator nodes capturing financial\nconstraints (poverty status, food insecurity). Food nodes link to\ningredient and category nodes describing compositional structure,\nnutrition tags reflecting nutrient profiles, and price tags denot-\ning affordability tiers. A successful recommender must therefore\ngenerate foods that align with user preferences while respecting\nhealth-derived nutritional constraints (e.g., restricting sodium for\nhypertensive users) and accommodating economic realities im-\nposed by poverty and limited food access.\nEvaluation Metrics. We fix the recommendation list length to\n𝐾= 20 and evaluate ranking quality using two standard metrics,\nRecall@20 and NDCG@20 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative\nGain). To assess whether recommendations are consistent with user-\nspecific dietary needs, we use the health-aware H-Score metric from\nprior work on personalized food recommendation: H-Score@20\nmeasures, for each user, the proportion of recommended foods that\nshare at least one required health or nutrition tag with the user,\nand then averages this value across users. To capture economic\naccessibility, we introduce PA@20 (Poverty Awareness@20). For\neach user, PA@20 computes the proportion of recommended foods\nwhose price tags are compatible with that user’s financial tags\n(for example low-price foods for users tagged with low income or\nfood insecurity) and averages this proportion across users. Higher\nPA@20 indicates that the model adapts recommendations to the\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "GLEN-Bench: A Graph-Language based Benchmark for Nutritional Health\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nuser’s budget constraints. Finally, we report AvgTags@20, the av-\nerage number of distinct relevant nutrition or health tags covered\nby the top-20 list, which reflects the informational richness and\ntag-level diversity of the recommended menu.\nBaseline Models and Setup. Baselines for this task (Table 2)\nfall into three categories. (i) Classical graph neural network base-\nlines: GCN [30], GraphSAGE [17], and GAT [59], applied to the\nuser-food interaction graph extracted from GLEN Nutrition-Health\nGraph. (ii) SOTA graph-based recommendation baselines: SGL [74],\nLightGCN [19], SimGCL [70], LightGCL [6], and NGCF [64], which\nare widely used in general recommendation benchmarks and opti-\nmized for ranking metrics. (iii) SOTA food recommendation base-\nlines: RecipeRec [57], HFRS-DA [14], and MOPI-HFRS [79], which\nexplicitly incorporate nutrition or health constraints and support\nmulti-objective recommendation. All methods are trained and eval-\nuated on the same user-food splits. We repeat experiments across\nmultiple random seeds and report mean and standard deviation.\nResults. Table 2 and Figure 4 link model behavior to archi-\ntectural traits. Figure 4 summarizes these effects at the family\nlevel, with panel (a) reporting dimension-wise performance and\npanel (b) aggregating metric averages. Baseline GNNs (GCN/Graph-\nSAGE/GAT) leverage local neighborhood aggregation on the user–\nfood graph. GAT achieves 10.17±0.30 Recall@20 and 8.58±0.17\nNDCG@20, indicating that neighborhood structure supports prefer-\nence aligned ranking. However, without explicitly modeling health\nand price, improvements on H-Score@20 and PA@20 are limited.\nThis indicates that interaction patterns alone cannot guarantee\nclinically and economically viable recommendations. Collaborative\nfiltering variants further strengthen collaborative signals. NGCF\nimproves ranking quality (e.g., 12.93±0.05 Recall@20 and 7.98±0.07\nNDCG@20), while LightGCN simplifies propagation and SimG-\nCL/SGL introduce contrastive regularization. These design choices\nyield steady gains on Recall and NDCG, yet H-Score and PA im-\nprove only marginally, reflecting the preference-centered objec-\ntive. Constraint-aware models exhibit a different pattern. HFRS-\nDA encodes typed relations among users, foods, health conditions,\nnutrition tags, and prices, and applies relation-specific attention,\nachieving 34.21±0.17 H-Score@20 and 27.78±0.75 PA@20 while\nmaintaining 12.78±0.27 Recall@20. This indicates that explicitly\nmodeling relational constraints can improve compliance without\nsacrificing ranking quality. MOPI-HFRS further couples relevance\nand constraint objectives via prompt-driven multi-objective opti-\nmization. It reaches 13.25±0.34 Recall@20, 9.97±0.61 NDCG@20,\n38.18±0.74 H-Score@20, and 26.84±1.07 PA@20, with 7.21±0.73\nAvgTags@20, indicating broader coverage of nutrition- and health-\nrelated attributes.\nOverall, these results highlight that improving ranking quality\ndoes not necessarily translate into better constraint satisfaction.\nMethods that explicitly encode multi-relational health and socioeco-\nnomic signals, and optimize for constraint-aware objectives, achieve\nmore clinically appropriate and economically feasible recommen-\ndations while preserving competitive Recall and NDCG.\n4.3\nNutritional Question Answering\nNutritional question answering helps build trust in dietary recom-\nmendations. Patients and providers need clear explanations before\nchanging diets, particularly in clinical contexts. Even when a model\ncan rank foods well, real-world adoption depends on whether it can\nexplain why a food is suitable (or unsuitable) given the user’s health\nconditions, dietary requirements, and socioeconomic constraints.\nThis task therefore complements risk detection and recommenda-\ntion by evaluating evidence-grounded reasoning and interpretabil-\nity. By requiring both tag-level attribution and language-based\nexplanations grounded in the GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph, nutri-\ntional QA assesses whether models can produce faithful, personal-\nized rationales rather than generic nutrition statements, supporting\ntransparency, user trust, and informed intervention decisions.\nTask Definition. Nutritional Question Answering (QA) tests\nwhether models can reason over the GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph\nand generate accurate, interpretable answers to personalized nu-\ntrition questions. Each question presents a user, a candidate food,\nand relevant graph context, asking whether the food is suitable\nand which nutrients or tags support the decision. We consider two\ncoupled views: multi-label classification to predict the supporting\nnutrition tags, and text generation to produce a natural-language\njustification.\nEvaluation Metrics. We evaluate QA along two corresponding\noutput views. For multi-label classification (ML), we report Accu-\nracy, Recall, Precision, F1, and AUC to measure how well the model\nrecovers the ground-truth supporting nutrition tags, balancing cov-\nerage (Recall) against spurious predictions (Precision/F1). For text\ngeneration (TG), we use ROUGE-1/2/L, BLEU, and BERTScore to\ncompare generated explanations with references in terms of overlap\nand semantic similarity, reflecting fluency and content fidelity.\nBaseline Models and Setup. We benchmark a range of large\nlanguage models and graph enhanced prompting strategies. For\neach backbone model (LLaMA3 and GPT-4), we first test a Plain\nsetting that directly prompts the model with the question, without\nrequiring explicit reasoning steps. We then include several rea-\nsoning oriented prompting methods such as CoT-Zero [31] and\nCoT-BAG [61], which encourage chain of thought reasoning, and\nToT [73] and GoT [4], which organize intermediate thoughts in\na tree or graph structure. To examine how graph knowledge af-\nfects performance, we test methods that combine retrieval from the\nGLEN Nutrition-Health Graph with LLM reasoning. We evaluate\nfour Graph RAG frameworks: KAPING [2] and ToG [55] retrieve\nand simplify subgraphs before generating answers, G-retriever [20]\nfocuses on retrieving high-quality graph information for reasoning,\nand KAR [71] incorporates retrieved knowledge triples and refines\nanswers iteratively. All methods share the same question templates\nand are evaluated on both ML and TG metrics, which allows us\nto compare pure prompting against graph aware pipelines and to\nquantify how much structured nutritional knowledge improves\npersonalized nutritional QA.\nResults Table 3 shows a clear pattern across backbones. Plain\nprompting reasons over the input without structured evidence, so it\ntends to over predict supporting tags and generates rationales that\ncontain generic phrases. Adding chain of thought variants such as\nCoT-Zero and CoT-BAG, or search style controllers such as ToT\nand GoT, organizes intermediate steps but still operates without\nexternal nutritional structure. The result is small and inconsistent\ngains in F1 and AUC and only modest movement in ROUGE and\nBERTScore.

Graph-\nbased retrieval methods perform much better because they focus on\nfinding high-quality evidence. KAPING and ToG first retrieve and\nfilter relevant subgraphs, then use them for generation. This im-\nproves AUC and ROUGE compared to direct prompting because the\nmodel now has access to specific nutrient and health information.\nG-retriever goes further by emphasizing retrieval accuracy. With\nLLaMA3, it achieves the best multi-label scores in its group, with\nthe highest F1 and AUC, and also improves ROUGE and BERTScore.\nThis shows that better subgraphs lead to fewer incorrect tags and\nmore accurate explanations. KAR uses a different approach by in-\ncorporating retrieved knowledge triples during answer generation.\nWith GPT-4, this method achieves the best F1 score among GPT-4\nvariants, while G-retriever produces the best ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L,\nand BERTScore. This demonstrates that strong retrieval improves\nexplanation quality even with powerful language models.\nTwo general patterns emerge from these results. First, retrieval\nquality determines multi-label performance: accurate graph infor-\nmation leads to better AUC and F1 scores and fewer incorrect\ntags. Second, model size primarily affects text generation: GPT-4\nproduces higher ROUGE and BERTScore than LLaMA3 with the\nsame retrieval method, though the relative ranking of retrieval ap-\nproaches remains stable across both models. These findings suggest\nchoosing the retrieval method before selecting the language model.\nUse methods like KAR when tag accuracy matters most, and use\nhigh-quality retrievers like G-retriever when clear, well-supported\nexplanations are the priority.\n5\nConclusion\nGLEN-Bench advances nutritional health research by combining\ndiet, clinical data, and socioeconomic factors in a single benchmark.\nOur evaluation shows that integrating graph-based reasoning with\nlanguage models improves performance on risk detection, person-\nalized recommendation, and interpretable explanations. This ap-\nproach better reflects real-world intervention workflows than treat-\ning these tasks separately. Results further highlight the importance\nof explicit relational structure and constraint-aware modeling for\nlearning meaningful representations and generating clinically ap-\npropriate, economically feasible recommendations. Beyond opioid\nuse disorder, GLEN-Bench generalizes to diverse nutrition-sensitive\nconditions (e.g., diabetes) and supports broader tasks such as meal\nplanning, adherence prediction, and food–drug interaction analysis.\nBy standardizing data, tasks, and evaluation protocols, GLEN-Bench\nenables systematic, reproducible progress toward fair and accessible\nnutrition-aware AI.\nReferences\n[1] Tagne Poupi Theodore Armand, Kintoh Allen Nfor, Jung-In Kim, and Hee-Cheol\nKim. 2024.

Together, these sources\nprovide a unified foundation for studying how health conditions,\ndietary behaviors, food composition, and real-world access con-\nstraints interact at scale.\nNHANES (2003–2020). We use NHANES cycles from 2003 to\n2020 and extract participant-level information from: (i) Demograph-\nics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity), (ii) Examination and Laboratory\nsections (e.g., BMI, blood pressure, metabolic biomarkers), (iii) Ques-\ntionnaire modules for diagnosed medical conditions (e.g., obesity,\nhypertension, depression) and behavioral factors (e.g., salt use, sup-\nplement intake), and (iv) Dietary modules for 24-hour dietary recalls\nand food consumption logs. We treat each participant as a user\n"}, {"page": 11, "text": "GLEN-Bench: A Graph-Language based Benchmark for Nutritional Health\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nnode and consolidate all available attributes into a unified user\nprofile via ID-based joins across modules. In addition, we derive\nsocioeconomic attributes including annual household income and\nfood insecurity indicators, which enable annotating users with\npoverty status and food insecurity risk—introducing real-world\nfeasibility constraints that are rarely modeled in nutrition-health\ndatasets. When multiple records exist across modules, we keep a\nsingle unified user record; missing values are preserved as blank\n(or imputed with simple statistics depending on the downstream\nmodel setting).\nFNDDS and WWEIA. Each NHANES consumed food item is\nrecorded with a food code. We map NHANES food codes to the\nFood and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to obtain\ncomprehensive nutrient profiles, and to What We Eat In Amer-\nica (WWEIA) to obtain standardized hierarchical food categories.\nThis mapping allows us to create food nodes equipped with nu-\ntrient vectors, and to organize foods through category nodes and\nstructured ingredient composition. Based on standardized nutrient\nthresholds, we further derive interpretable nutrition_tag labels to\nsupport downstream tasks that require explicit nutritional justifica-\ntions.\nUSDA Purchase-to-Plate. To incorporate real-world affordabil-\nity constraints, we augment each food with price estimates from\nthe USDA Purchase-to-Plate pipeline. Prices are normalized to cost\nper 100 grams and discretized into a small set of affordability tiers,\nrepresented as price_tag nodes (Low/Medium/High). These tiers\napproximate the relative economic burden of selecting specific\nfoods and enable models to jointly reason about nutritional suitabil-\nity and accessibility, which distinguishes GLEN-Bench from prior\nnutrition-oriented graph resources that typically ignore economic\nfeasibility.\nA.2\nGraph Schema and Statistics\nWe model GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph as a heterogeneous graph\n𝐺= (V, E, T, R), where each node 𝑣∈V is assigned a node type\n𝜏(𝑣) ∈T and each edge 𝑒∈E is assigned a relation type 𝜙(𝑒) ∈R.\nThe graph includes user, food, ingredient, category, dietary habit,\nhealth condition, nutrition tag, price tag, poverty condition, and\nopioid-level nodes, with edges capturing observed consumption,\nfood composition/category structure, nutrition and price tagging,\nand user-specific clinical/socioeconomic associations. We report\nthe detailed node/relation statistics in Table 4.\nItem\nCount\nNodes\n# User = 104,244, # Food = 9,640, # Ingredient = 36,591, # Cate-\ngory = 36,718, # Habit = 48, # Health Condition = 19, # Nutrition\nTag = 18, # Poverty Condition = 1, # Price Tag = 3, # Opioid\nLevel = 3\nRelations\n# User–Food = 1,803,215, # User–Habit = 652,277, # User–Health\nCondition = 145,650, # User–Poverty Condition = 35,033, #\nUser–Opioid Level = 98,448, # Food–Ingredient = 31,510, #\nFood–Category = 8,388, # Food–Nutrition Tag = 52,582, # Food–\nPrice Tag = 7,683, # Health Condition–Nutrition Tag = 23, #\nPoverty Condition–Price Tag = 1\nTable 4: The statistics of GLEN Nutrition-Health Graph.\nA.3\nNode Features and Representations\nWe associate each node with a feature vector, with different sources\ndepending on the node type.\nUser Nodes. Each user node 𝑢is associated with a feature vector\n𝑥𝑢∈R𝑑𝑢, constructed by concatenating demographic attributes and\nclinical/laboratory measurements extracted from NHANES (e.g.,\nBMI, blood pressure, metabolic biomarkers). Diagnosed conditions,\ndietary habits, poverty-related constraints, and opioid status are\nmodeled as explicit neighbors rather than being fully absorbed into\n𝑥𝑢.\nFood Nodes. Each food node 𝑓is associated with a continuous\nnutrient vector 𝑥𝑓∈R𝑑𝑓, derived from FNDDS nutrient profiles.\nThese nutrient values are also used to derive threshold-based nutri-\ntion tags (Section 6).\nCategorical/semantic nodes. For non-numeric node types such\nas ingredient, category, habit, health_condition, nutrition_tag, price_tag,\nand poverty_condition, we represent their semantics using pre-\ntrained BERT embeddings over their textual names or descriptions,\nproducing fixed-length vectors as node representations. This pro-\nvides a unified embedding space for symbolic concepts that do not\nhave natural numeric features.\nA.4\nDietary Habit Extraction\nDietary habit information is compiled from NHANES diet- and\nbehavior-related questionnaires. Due to the categorical diversity of\nthese responses, we perform a structured feature-to-habit mapping:\na team of four reviewers identifies questionnaire indicators that\ndescribe habitual dietary patterns (e.g., awareness toward healthy\neating, frequency of consuming certain food types). For each habit-\nrelated feature, we apply a top/bottom quantile strategy: par-\nticipants in the top 10% and bottom 10% (by frequency or ordinal\nresponse) are assigned corresponding habit tags. This process yields\n48 distinct habit concepts, each modeled as a habit node, connected\nto users via User–Habit edges.\nA.5\nHealth Risk Label Generation (Opioid\nStatus)\nWe construct a three-level opioid status label for evaluation and cre-\nate opioid_level nodes (3 levels). Users are connected to their cor-\nresponding level via User-Opioid_Level edges. Following NHANES\ndrug-use and prescription-related records, we operationalize:\n• Active Opioid Users: users with evidence of heroin use within\nthe past year, or continuous prescription opioid use for over 90\ndays.\n• Opioid-Recovered Users: users with a history of opioid use\nbut without the criteria of active misuse in the current period\n(derived from NHANES history/current-use signals).\n• Normal Users: users with no record indicating opioid misuse\nor long-term prescription history.\nNote that not all users have opioid-related records; therefore, we\nonly create User-Opioid_Level edges when the relevant modules\nare available (98,448 labeled users in the graph statistics).\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nHuang et al.\nA.6\nTagging Scheme\nGLEN includes two coupled tagging mechanisms: (i) food-level\nnutrition tags derived from nutrient thresholds, and (ii) health-\ndriven dietary requirement tags that connect clinical indicators\nto recommended nutrition constraints.\nNutrition Tags from Nutrient Thresholds (Food →Tag)\nWe define a fixed set of nutrition_tag nodes and assign them to\nfoods using nutrient thresholding. Specifically, for each food 𝑓and\nnutrient dimension 𝑘, we compare the nutrient value against pre-\ndefined low/high thresholds to determine whether 𝑓satisfies a tag.\nThe thresholds used in GLEN are summarized in Table 6, together\nwith recommended reference values (NRV) when applicable.\nTag assignment. Given food nutrient vector 𝑥𝑓, a tag is added if\nthe corresponding threshold condition holds. For example:\n• Low Sodium: sodium(𝑓) ≤120 mg;\n• High Protein: protein(𝑓) ≥15 g;\n• Low Sugar: sugar(𝑓) ≤5 g;\n• High Fiber: fiber(𝑓) ≥6 g.\nWe then create Food-NutritionTag edges for all satisfied tags (52,582\nedges in the final graph).\nHealth Indicators to Dietary Requirement Tags (Condition\n→Tag) In addition to food-level tags, we encode clinical dietary re-\nquirements by connecting health_condition nodes to recommended\nnutrition_tag nodes. This captures domain-guided associations such\nas ”hypertension →low sodium” and enables downstream tasks\n(e.g., personalized recommendation and QA) to reason over inter-\npretable constraint paths.\nWe summarize the condition-to-tag mapping used in GLEN in\nTable 5. Each row defines a set of recommended tags for a health\nindicator. We instantiate these as Health_Condition-Nutrition_Tag\nedges (23 edges in total).\nPrice Tags and Affordability Constraints (Food →PriceTag)\nWe discretize normalized price (cost per 100g) into three tiers and\nrepresent them with price_tag nodes: low_price, medium_price and\nhigh_price.\nPoverty Condition and Economic Access (User →Poverty-\nCondition) We represent extreme socioeconomic constraint with\na poverty_condition node, and connect users meeting the criterion\nthrough User-PovertyCondition edges. We further anchor afford-\nability constraints by linking PovertyCondition–PriceTag, enabling\nmodels to jointly reason about nutritional suitability and economic\nfeasibility.\nB\nEXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\nB.1\nEnvironmental Settings\nAll experiments are conducted on a Linux server equipped with\ntwo NVIDIA A100 GPUs (40GB each).

For training-based methods,\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "GLEN-Bench: A Graph-Language based Benchmark for Nutritional Health\nConference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nwe select the checkpoint with the best validation performance and\nreport test results using that checkpoint.\nB.3\nHyperparameters\nWe adopt unified training settings across methods whenever ap-\nplicable to ensure fair comparison, and select model checkpoints\nbased on validation performance.\nOpioid misuse detection. All GNN-based models are optimized\nwith Adam for 500 epochs using hidden dimension 256 and dropout\n0.6. We report mean±std over 10 random seeds. We apply dropout\nin message passing layers and choose learning rate and weight\ndecay from a small preset range on the validation set.\nPersonalized food recommendation. We formulate recommenda-\ntion as implicit-feedback ranking and train all recommenders using\nthe BPR objective with negative sampling. We fix the recommenda-\ntion list length to 𝐾=20. For a balanced comparison across meth-\nods, we use a unified configuration with hidden dimension 128\nand Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-3, L2 regularization 1e-6)\nfor up to 500 epochs, and apply a learning-rate decay step every\n200 epochs. All methods are trained and evaluated on the same\n60/20/20 user-level split (performed once with a fixed split seed),\nand we select the best validation checkpoint for final test reporting.\nIf a baseline is unstable under the shared configuration, we apply\nminimal adjustments within the same hyperparameter family to\nensure convergence, while keeping the protocol and evaluation\nunchanged.\nNutritional question answering (multi-label + explanation). For\nQA baselines (prompting, reasoning-oriented prompting, and graph-\ngrounded pipelines), we evaluate both multi-label tag prediction and\nexplanation generation following Section 4.3.2. To reduce variance,\nwe keep decoding settings fixed within each LLM backbone and do\nnot tune decoding hyperparameters on the test set.\nC\nFINE-GRAINED CORRELATION BETWEEN\nDIETARY PATTERNS AND OPIOID MISUSE\nTo contextualize the opioid misuse detection task (Section 4.1), we\nanalyze fine-grained differences in medical status and dietary/lifestyle\nhabits across opioid, recovered, and normal user groups in NHANES.\nTable 7 summarizes the number of users exhibiting each indicator\nin the three groups and reports significance using Chi-square tests.\nAs shown in Table 7, we observe consistent and statistically\nsignificant distribution shifts across both medical conditions (e.g.,\nsleep disorder, depression, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, CKD,\ndyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, liver disease) and dietary habits (e.g.,\ndiet quality, frozen/ready-to-eat food consumption, eating outside\nthe home, supplement intake, salt-related behaviors), together with\ntobacco- and alcohol-related indicators. These results indicate that\nopioid misuse is associated with systematic behavioral and clinical\nsignatures beyond any single variable. This motivates Task 1 to\nevaluate whether computational models can screen at-risk users\nby jointly leveraging multi-view signals encoded in the GLEN\nNutrition-Health Graph.\nTable 7: Statistical analysis of medical status and dietary\nhabits across opioid, recovered, and normal user groups.\nCategory\n# Opioid\n# Recov.\n# Normal\np-value\nUsers\nUsers\nUsers\nNHANES Data\n3104\n437\n94907\n-\nMedical Status\nSleep Disorder\n989\n99\n7607\n< 0.001\nDepression\n1337\n167\n10733\n< 0.001\nObesity\n1155\n138\n17554\n< 0.001\nHypertension\n667\n80\n10038\n< 0.001\nDiabetes\n313\n23\n3681\n< 0.001\nAnemia\n749\n69\n20606\n< 0.001\nCKD\n589\n48\n5286\n< 0.001\nDyslipidemia\n1328\n188\n26867\n< 0.001\nHyperuricemia\n692\n80\n10570\n< 0.001\nLiver disease\n480\n122\n13267\n< 0.001\nDietary Habits\nDrinks little or no milk\n591\n77\n11609\n< 0.001\nAdds lots of salt at table\n507\n96\n9331\n< 0.001\nEats lots of frozen food\n296\n49\n7022\n< 0.001\nEats often outside the home\n266\n65\n9318\n< 0.001\nEats many ready to eat meals\n366\n57\n9271\n< 0.001\nTakes few or no supplements\n1217\n222\n52799\n< 0.001\nUses lots of salt in preparation\n968\n185\n33868\n< 0.001\nClaims to have a poor diet\n1090\n149\n15975\n< 0.001\nLight cigarette smoker\n529\n65\n11443\n< 0.001\nHeavy cigarette smoker\n172\n57\n3193\n< 0.001\nUses tobacco rarely\n90\n21\n1765\n< 0.001\nUses tobacco often\n407\n65\n2771\n< 0.001\nDrinks Alcohol more than average\n923\n200\n7799\n< 0.001\nNote: 𝑝-values are calculated using Chi-square tests to indicate statistical\nsignificance across the three groups.\nD\nPROMPT DESIGN\nFor nutritional question answering (Section 4.3), we use a unified\nprompt template with method-specific wrappers. Each instance\nprovides (i) a user and a candidate food, (ii) a compact graph context\nserialized as a node list and an edge list, and (iii) an explicit output\nformat constraint to ensure parseable predictions.\nWe control output strictness through difficulty-conditioned notes.\nFor medium difficulty, the model outputs a comma-separated list\nof nutrition tags (e.g., high_carb, low_sodium) chosen from a fixed\noption set. For hard difficulty, the model outputs a binary decision\n(Yes/No) followed by a short rationale that explicitly references the\nselected tags. Across prompting baselines, we keep the core instruc-\ntion fixed and only vary the wrapper that introduces the auxiliary\nevidence (e.g., plain prompting, chain-of-thought style instruction,\nor graph-grounded retrieval outputs such as KAPING/ToG/GoT/G-\nRetriever/KAR).\nWhile the core template remains identical, different baselines\nintroduce the auxiliary evidence with lightweight wrapper instruc-\ntions that mirror their intended reasoning or retrieval mechanism.\nPlain uses only the shared instruction and the serialized graph\ncontext without additional reasoning cues. CoT-Zero appends a\nstep-by-step instruction, encouraging the model to explicitly (i)\nextract the food’s nutrition tags from the graph, (ii) compare them\nagainst the user’s health conditions and required tags, and (iii) form\na final judgement. CoT-BaG follows the same core objective but\nemphasizes that the input evidence is a directed graph description,\nprompting the model to interpret nodes and edges as structured\nfacts.\nFor retrieval-augmented graph baselines, the wrapper primarily\nclarifies the provenance and intended use of the provided evidence.\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "Conference acronym ’XX, June 03–05, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nHuang et al.\nPrompt 1: Nutritional QA Prompt Template\nSystem Message: You are a nutrition-aware QA agent.

ToT and GoT additionally provide in-\ntermediate reasoning artifacts produced by tree/graph-structured\nsearch and aggregation, and the wrapper instructs the model to use\nthese artifacts as supporting evidence rather than generating un-\nsupported facts. G-Retriever specifies that the context is a compact\nsubgraph selected by Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization\nto balance relevance and brevity, encouraging faithful use of the\nretrieved neighborhood. Finally, KAR introduces knowledge-aware\nretrieved information (e.g., filtered triples and refined context) and\ninstructs the model to ground both tag attribution and explanation\nin these retrieved facts.\nAcross all wrappers, we keep the allowed nutrition-tag vocabu-\nlary fixed and enforce the same output-format constraints, so that\nperformance differences reflect the quality of evidence selection\nand reasoning rather than prompt leakage or formatting freedom.\nE\nADDITIONAL RELATED WORK\nGraph Representation Learning Graph neural networks have\nbecome essential for learning from structured relational data. Het-\nerogeneous graph neural networks [75] extend standard GNNs to\nhandle multiple node and edge types, enabling richer modeling\nof complex systems with diverse entities and relationships. This\nmulti-relational capability is particularly valuable when reasoning\nrequires understanding interactions across different types of con-\nnections. Real-world graphs often contain noise, missing edges, and\nstructural errors. Graph structure refinement methods [80] address\nthese challenges by learning to adaptively adjust topology during\ntraining, improving robustness to data quality issues. Many graph\nlearning tasks also face severe class imbalance, where target nodes\nor patterns are rare. Contrastive learning approaches [46, 47] have\nshown effectiveness in such settings through self-supervised objec-\ntives that learn representations without requiring extensive labels,\nenabling pre-training on large unlabeled graphs before fine-tuning\non specific tasks. Fairness in graph learning has gained attention as\nmodels may amplify biases present in training data, leading to dis-\nparate performance across subgroups [40]. Recent work on graph\nfoundation models [66] aims to build transferable representations\nthat generalize across different graphs and domains, reducing the\nneed for task-specific training data and enabling efficient adaptation\nto new applications.\nF\nETHICS AND PRIVACY STATEMENT\nGLEN-Bench is constructed from publicly available, population-\nlevel resources and is designed with privacy and ethical considera-\ntions as first-class requirements. Our primary human data source,\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),\nis released under strict confidentiality safeguards and public-data\npolicies. The NHANES records we use are de-identified and do\nnot contain personally identifiable information (PII) such as social\nsecurity numbers, names, phone numbers, or physical addresses.\nWe additionally follow a data minimization principle: our bench-\nmark focuses on variables necessary for nutrition-health assessment\n(e.g., demographic attributes, clinical measurements, dietary recalls,\nand questionnaire-derived behaviors) and does not attempt to re-\nidentify individuals or link records to external identity sources.\nGLEN-Bench integrates NHANES with food composition and cat-\negory information (FNDDS/WWEIA) and aggregated price/access\nsignals (USDA Purchase-to-Plate) to study clinically appropriate\nand feasible nutrition interventions. These auxiliary resources do\nnot introduce individual-level identifiers; they provide food-level\nnutrition and affordability context that supports constraint-aware\nmodeling. We report results in aggregate and do not release any\ninformation that could enable tracing predictions back to specific\nsurvey participants.\nWe recognize that nutrition and substance-use–related variables\ncan be sensitive. As a benchmark, GLEN-Bench is intended for re-\nsearch on equitable decision support rather than automated clinical\ndecision-making. Any real-world deployment should include ad-\nditional safeguards, including access control, secure storage, audit\nlogging, and human oversight, and should treat recommendations\nand explanations as protected health information within clinical\nworkflows.

First, the benchmark is built on observational survey data\n(NHANES) and derived resources, which introduces confounding\nand measurement noise (e.g., imperfect 24-hour recalls and ques-\ntionnaire responses). As a result, strong performance should be\ninterpreted as capturing reliable associations rather than causal\neffects, and models may exploit spurious shortcuts. A promising\ndirection is to incorporate evaluations that stress-test robustness\nto confounding and missingness, such as sensitivity analyses, sub-\ngroup robustness checks, and counterfactual or intervention-style\nvariants (e.g., whether a model’s recommendation changes appro-\npriately when specific constraints or nutrient targets are perturbed).\nSecond, the feasibility signals in GLEN-Bench are necessarily\nsimplified. Price tags and access-related constraints are estimated\nat an aggregate level and may not reflect local availability, seasonal\nprice variation, or individual purchasing context. Similarly, practical\ndietary decision-making often depends on additional constraints\nnot fully represented here—cultural preferences, allergies, cook-\ning skills, time budget, household composition, and condition- or\nmedication-specific restrictions. Future versions of the benchmark\ncould enrich these dimensions by adding finer-grained SDoH vari-\nables, dynamic affordability/availability indicators, and structured\npreference profiles, enabling more realistic evaluation of what it\nmeans for recommendations to be simultaneously clinically appro-\npriate and actionable.\nThird, while our task suite captures a realistic workflow (screen-\ning →recommending →explaining), the current metrics do not\nfully measure clinical utility, long-term adherence, or safety be-\nyond tag-level compliance. In particular, LLM-based methods can\ngenerate fluent rationales that are not faithfully grounded in graph\nevidence. An important future direction is to strengthen faithful-\nness and safety evaluation: auditing whether explanations cite re-\ntrieved evidence, checking consistency between predicted tags and\ngenerated rationales, calibrating model confidence (including ab-\nstention on uncertain cases), and incorporating human-in-the-loop\nevaluation protocols that reflect clinical and public-health decision\nprocesses. More broadly, GLEN-Bench opens opportunities for ad-\nditional tasks such as nutrient-aware substitution, meal planning\nunder budget and nutrient constraints, adherence prediction, and\nfood–drug interaction analysis, which would further align bench-\nmarking with real-world nutrition interventions.\nOverall, we view GLEN-Bench as an evolving platform. The cur-\nrent release establishes a reproducible, multi-task benchmark with\nexplicit socioeconomic constraints, while future work can deepen\ncausal rigor, broaden population coverage, enrich constraint mod-\neling, and improve faithfulness and safety assessment for nutrition-\naware decision support.\n"}]}
