Email: hzycs@mit.edu\nit inherits a fundamental exploration–exploitation\ntrade-off, which becomes particularly pronounced\nin complex reasoning tasks. LLMs training tend\nto prematurely converge to a small set of high-\nprobability reasoning patterns that yield strong\nshort-term rewards (Cui et al., 2025a; Yue et al.,\n2025), leading to policy collapse and limited cover-\nage of the solution space. As a result, insufficient\nexploration has emerged as a major bottleneck for\nscaling RL on LLMs. LLM reasoning produces\nlong, multi-step rollouts. Encouraging randomness\nat the token level can increase surface variation, yet\nstill yield highly similar reasoning modes and solu-\ntion structures. As a result, token-level diversity is\nan imperfect proxy for exploration, and we instead\ntarget trajectory/strategy-level diversity.\nDespite recent progress in exploration-aware RL\nfor LLMs, such as entropy bonuses (Cheng et al.,\n2025), low-probability regularization (Huang et al.,\n2025), or pass@k-based objectives (Chen et al.,\n2025b), most methods encourage diversity indi-\nrectly through easy-to-measure signals like token\nentropy or embedding distance. These signals can\nincrease variation in wording or sampling behavior,\nbut they do not necessarily produce diverse solu-\ntion strategies or broader coverage of the search\nspace. For x2 −5x + 6 = 0, two rollouts may\nboth use the quadratic formula but differ only in\nalgebraic presentation. One shows intermediate\nsteps like x = 5±√25−24\n2\nand simplifies step-by-\nstep, the other simplifies immediately to x = 5±1\n2 .\nToken-level entropy (or embedding distance) can\ntreat them as “diverse”, even though they share\nthe same high-level strategy. By contrast, factor-\ning (x −2)(x −3) = 0 is a genuinely different\nsolution path. This distinction matters in practice.\nUnder pass@k, performance depends on maintain-\ning multiple conceptually distinct strategies across\nk samples, not merely producing superficial token-\nlevel variation. As a result, RL training often im-\narXiv:2601.08763v2  [cs.LG]  15 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "proves pass@1 while silently eroding rollout-level\ndiversity of solution strategies, leading to stagnant\nor even degraded pass@k, especially on hard rea-\nsoning tasks where users rely on multiple samples.\nIn what follows, we sample K rollouts per prob-\nlem during training and evaluate pass@k with k\ntest-time samples (typically k ≥K), reporting\nAUC@k as the area under the pass@k curve.\nIn this work, we take a different perspective. We\nargue that the right object to regularize is not\ntokens, but sets of rollouts (i.e., multiple sam-\npled solution attempts) for a given instance, and\nthat the notion of diversity is not surface semantics\nbut strategy-level coverage. Concretely, we intro-\nduce a uniqueness-aware RL objective, which es-\ntimates each rollout’s strategy uniqueness relative\nto other candidates for the same problem, while\nseparately verifying correctness with a problem-\nspecific verifier. For each problem, we generate\nmultiple rollouts and use a judge model (an LLM\nor a lightweight classifier) to cluster them by their\nhigh-level solution plan, while explicitly ignoring\ndifferences that are purely stylistic or local. We\nquantify a rollout’s strategy uniqueness using the\nsize of its cluster, so rollouts in smaller clusters\ncorrespond to rarer strategies. We then integrate\nuniqueness and correctness into policy optimiza-\ntion by shaping the advantage. Correct rollouts\nthat instantiate rare strategies receive amplified ef-\nfective advantages, redundant correct rollouts are\ndownweighted, and incorrect rollouts remain penal-\nized. This “rewarding the rare” scheme incentivizes\neach rollout set to contain multiple correct and\nstrategically distinct solutions, improving pass@k\nwithout sacrificing pass@1.\nEmpirically,\nwe evaluate our method on\nQwen2.5-7B (Yang et al., 2025b), Qwen3-8B\n(Yang et al., 2025a), and OLMo-3-7B (Olmo et al.,\n2025) across diverse reasoning benchmarks, includ-\ning mathematics (AIME (Mathematical Associa-\ntion of America) and HLE (Humanity’s Last Exam)\n(Phan et al., 2025)), physics (OlympiadBench (He\net al., 2024)), and medicine (MedCaseReasoning\n(Wu et al., 2025)).Across settings, our method en-\nhances exploration and maintains strong perfor-\nmance as the sampling budget increases, up to\nk=256, avoiding strategy collapse that limits base-\nline approaches. Further analyses show increased\ncoverage of human-annotated solution strategies,\nvalidating that our gains reflect strategy-level ex-\nploration, not superficial variation.\n2\nRelated Work\nExploration collapse and token-level treatments.\nRecent work on RL for LLM reasoning has high-\nlighted a pronounced form of exploration collapse,\nwhere continued training drives the policy toward\na single “canonical” solution pattern per problem:\nentropy shrinks, pass@1 may increase, but the di-\nversity of rollouts and gains in pass@k stagnate.\nA first line of approaches addresses this through\nentropy-based techniques, such as entropy bonuses\nand entropy-based scaling laws that predict and\ncontrol target entropy over the course of training\n(Cui et al., 2025b; Wang et al., 2025), or clip-\nping schemes (e.g., Clip-Low/High) that explic-\nitly avoid both near-greedy and overly random\ntoken-level distributions. Closer to our focus on\nrare behavior, low-probability regularization (Cui\net al., 2025b) and follow-up work like “Beyond\nthe 80/20 Rule”(Wang et al., 2025) show that a\nsmall fraction of high-entropy, low-probability to-\nkens carry disproportionate learning signal and are\ncrucial for sustaining exploration under verifiable\nreward. These methods introduce regularizers that\nprotect or amplify such tokens instead of letting RL\nsuppress them completely. However, all of these\ntechniques operate at the token or local distribution\nlevel. They do not distinguish whether two roll-\nouts, built from different token trajectories, instan-\ntiate the same high-level solution idea or genuinely\ndifferent strategies, and thus they cannot directly\ncontrol diversity at the level of solution strategies\nwithin a problem.\nDiversity-aware objectives, pass@k training,\nand tradeoff between quality and diversity. A\ncomplementary line of work incorporates diversity\nmore directly into the RL objective. Diversity-\naware RL methods such as DARLING learn a\nsemantic partitioning of answers and feed both\nquality and diversity scores into online RL, im-\nproving both utility and novelty across instruc-\ntion following, creative writing, and competition\nmath (Li et al., 2025). Pass@k-oriented objectives\n(Yao et al., 2025; Walder and Karkhanis, 2025)(in-\ncluding diversity-aware policy optimization and\nPotential@k-style training) view multiple rollouts\nper prompt as a set, emphasizing problems where\npass@k is already high but pass@1 remains low,\nand using the gap between them to focus opti-\nmization on samples that still have untapped poten-\ntial.

More recently, SEED-GRPO (Chen et al.,\n2025a) introduces semantic entropy as a prompt-\nlevel uncertainty signal for GRPO, scaling update\nmagnitudes based on how semantically dispersed\na problem’s answers are, but treating diversity pri-\nmarily as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty. In con-\ntrast to all of the above, our method works at the\nrollout set level for each problem. We use an LLM\njudge to cluster full reasoning traces into high-level\nsolution strategies and then reweight group-based\nadvantages inversely with cluster size, so that cor-\nrect but rare strategies receive larger effective up-\ndates. Conceptually, this can be viewed as import-\ning a quality and diversity-style bias into RL for\nLLM reasoning and unifying ideas from pass@k\ntraining and rare-token regularization, but at the\nlevel of rollout-level strategy uniqueness, rather\nthan token entropy or prompt uncertainty.\n3\nMethodology\nWe build on a standard group-based reinforce-\nment learning framework for large language mod-\nels, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024). As shown in Figure 1,\nour method is to make the advantage explicitly\nuniqueness-aware at the level of solution strategies.\nWithin each group of rollouts for the same problem,\nwe detect which rollouts correspond to the same\nhigh-level idea and which ones embody genuinely\ndifferent strategies. We then reweight the GRPO\nadvantages so that correct but rare strategies re-\nceive larger effective advantages, while correct but\nvery common strategies are downweighted. This\nsection describes the components of this procedure.\n3.1\nOverview\nLet M denote the set of training problems. For\na given problem m ∈M, the current policy πθ\nproduces K rollouts {pm,k}K\nk=1, where each pm,k\nis a full reasoning trace (e.g., chain-of-thought)\nending with a final answer. A task-specific verifier\nassigns a scalar reward rm,k to each rollout, e.g.,\nrm,k ∈{0, 1} for pass/fail, or a graded score.\nIn vanilla GRPO, rollouts for the same problem\nare treated as a group. Let µm and σm be the mean\nand standard deviation of rewards within the group\nfor problem m. The group-normalized advantage\nfor rollout pm,k is then\nzm,k = rm,k −µm\nσm + ε\n(1)\nwhere ε is a small constant for numerical stability.\nPolicy parameters are updated using a GRPO-style\nobjective with zm,k as the advantage. We keep the\nform of the GRPO training objective, except that\nwe replace the advantages zm,k with a uniqueness-\nweighted advantage. The key extra ingredient is a\nrollout-level measure of solution-strategy unique-\nness, defined and computed as follows.\n3.2\nUniqueness Calculation\nOur goal is to estimate, for each rollout pm,k, how\nmany other rollouts for the same problem m (i.e.,\nwithin the same GRPO group) follow essentially\nthe same high-level solution idea. We define strate-\ngies at the level of plans or decompositions of the\nproblem, rather than surface wording.\nFor a given problem m with rollouts {pm,k}K\nk=1,\nwe employ an LLM-based judge J to partition the\nrollouts into strategy clusters. In our implementa-\ntion, the judge is drawn from the same model fam-\nily as the policy being trained, but we use a larger\nvariant (e.g., if training a 7B model, we use the 32B\nversion from the same family) to ensure stronger\nreasoning and classification capability. Importantly,\nthe judge operates in inference-only mode to avoid\nadditional training cost. Formally, we denote the\nstructured output of the judge as\nCm = J\n\u0000m, {pm,k}K\nk=1\n\u0001\n=\n\b\nS(m)\nc\n\tCm\nc=1\n(2)\nwhere each S(m)\nc\n⊆{1, . . . , K} is a set of rollout\nindices assigned to the same high-level solution\nidea (i.e., a strategy cluster), and {S(m)\nc\n}Cm\nc=1 forms\na partition of {1, . . . , K} (disjoint union).\nThe judge is prompted with the problem state-\nment and all K reasoning traces in a single query.\nThe prompt instructs the judge to: (1) identify the\ncore high-level solution idea in each rollout (e.g.,\n\"factorization,\" \"quadratic formula,\" \"graphical in-\nterpretation\"), (2) group rollouts that pursue the\nsame mathematical or logical approach, ignoring\nsuperficial differences such as variable naming, al-\ngebraic rearrangement, or verbosity, and (3) re-\nturn the partition {S(m)\nc\n} in a structured JSON for-\nmat for automated parsing.

Given a training problem, we sample multiple rollouts and\ncompute group-normalized GRPO advantages from verifiable rewards. An LLM judge groups rollouts that share\nthe same high-level solution strategy, producing a partition and cluster sizes. We then form uniqueness-weighted\nadvantages, allocating more learning signal to correct but rare strategies and preventing strategy collapse.\nstrating the distinction between strategy-level sim-\nilarity and surface-level variation, is provided in\nAppendix A.\nGiven this partition, each rollout index k belongs\nto a unique strategy cluster S(m)\nc(k). We define the\nsize of the strategy cluster for rollout pm,k as\nfm,k =\n\f\fS(m)\nc(k)\n\f\f =\n\f\f{pm,k′ : k′ ∈S(m)\nc(k)}\n\f\f\n(3)\nIntuitively, fm,k counts how many rollouts for prob-\nlem m share the same high-level idea as pm,k. Sin-\ngletons or very small clusters correspond to rare\nstrategies, while large clusters correspond to com-\nmon strategies repeatedly produced by the policy.\n3.3\nCombining Quality and Creativity\nWe combine rollout quality and solution-strategy\nuniqueness in a single advantage. Starting from the\nGRPO group-normalized term zm,k in Eq. (1), we\nintroduce a uniqueness weight wm,k based on the\nstrategy-cluster size fm,k:\nwm,k =\n1\nfα\nm,k\n(4)\nwhere α ∈[0, 1] controls the strength of the\nreweighting.\nNote that fm,k\n∈[1, K] for a\nfixed group size K, hence Eq. (4) yields bounded\nweights wm,k ∈[K−α, 1]. This rules out weight\nexplosion for singleton clusters and limits per-\nproblem scale variation.\nMoreover, the group-\nnormalized term zm,k in Eq. (1) further stabilizes\nthe update magnitude under the GRPO-style ob-\njective. If needed, one can additionally temper or\nnormalize wm,k within each problem as a straight-\nforward safeguard. The final advantage used for\npolicy updates is the product:\nadvantagem,k = wm,k zm,k\n=\n1\nfα\nm,k\n· rm,k −µm\nσm + ε\n(5)\nWhen α = 0, wm,k = 1 for all rollouts and we re-\ncover standard GRPO. For α > 0, rollouts belong-\ning to large strategy clusters (common strategies)\nare downweighted, while rollouts in small clusters\n(rare strategies) retain a larger effective weight.\nBecause zm,k already reflects correctness and\ndifficulty at the problem level, Eq. (5) can be in-\nterpreted as: among rollouts with positive quality\nsignal for the same problem, those that embody\nrare solution strategies receive a larger advantage\nthan those that simply repeat the dominant strategy.\nIncorrect rollouts typically have non-positive zm,k,\nand remain penalized regardless of wm,k.\n3.4\nTraining Objective\nOur method keeps the form of the GRPO training\nobjective unchanged, modifying only the advantage\nterm. Let B denote a batch of problems and their\nsampled rollouts, where for each m ∈B we sample\na group {pm,k}K\nk=1. The policy-gradient objective\ncan be written as\nJ(θ) = Em∈B, k∈{1,...,K}\nh\nadvantagem,k log πθ(pm,k | m)\ni\n(6)\nIn practice, we combine this term with GRPO regu-\nlarization (e.g., KL penalties or clipping) and opti-\nmize it using standard stochastic gradient methods.\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Conceptually, our method can be seen as a drop-\nin replacement for the GRPO advantage that en-\ncourages the policy to allocate probability mass not\nonly to high-reward solutions, but also across multi-\nple high-level solution strategies for each problem,\nwhich is directly aligned with improving pass@k\nand creative problem-solving behavior.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nTraining datasets for RL.\nFor mathemat-\nics,\nwe\nuse\na\ndifficulty-filtered\nsubset\nof\nMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), selecting 8,523\nproblems from Levels 3–5 (harder problems) for\nRL training.

As for physics, we evaluate\non a specific subset of OlympiadBench (He et al.,\n2024), using the text-only English competition split\n(236 problems). In medicine, we assess the model\non the official MedCaseReasoning test set (Wu\net al., 2025), which contains 897 held-out clinical\ncases with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning.\nAcross all benchmarks, we report pass@k as our\nprimary metric and additionally summarize perfor-\nmance by AUC@K, the normalized area under the\npass@k curve over k = 1..K, computed via the\ntrapezoidal rule:\nAUC@K =\n1\nK −1\nK−1\nX\nk=1\npass@k + pass@(k + 1)\n2\n(7)\nwhich yields a scalar in [0, 1] summarizing overall\npass@k performance across budgets k = 1..K.\nModels.\nWe conduct RL training on Qwen-2.5-\n7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025), OLMo-3-7B-\nInstruct (Olmo et al., 2025), and Qwen-3-8B-\nInstruct (Yang et al., 2025a), and report results for\nboth the RL-trained models and their original per-\nformances as baselines in our main results.

As\nK increases to 256, gains shrink as the curves satu-\nrate, while the ranking stays the same.\nFor OLMo-3-7B and Qwen-3-8B (Table 2), we\nreport HLE/Physics where AUC@K is more dis-\ncriminative given their already high baseline ac-\ncuracies on AIME/Medicine. Our method again\nachieves the best AUC@K against both Instruct\nand SimpleRL, and importantly also surpasses\nalternative exploration/diversity-oriented training\nrecipes, DAPO and Forking Token, that improve\nexploration abilities from different angles. For ex-\nample on Qwen-3-8B at K=64, our method im-\nproves over DAPO (HLE: 0.201→0.217; Physics:\n0.361→0.365) and over Forking Token (HLE:\n0.205→0.217; Physics: 0.354→0.365), supporting\nthat our uniqueness-Aware RL provides comple-\nmentary and stronger gains in strategy coverage.\n4.3\nSustaining Exploration: Entropy\nDynamics under RL\nIn this section, we study whether RL training can\nsustain exploration by tracking the policy entropy\nthroughout training, defined as the token-level en-\ntropy Ht = −P\nv∈V pθ(v | x<t) log pθ(v | x<t),\naveraged over generation steps. Figure 3 compares\nSimpleRL (with GRPO) with our method across\nthree backbones (Qwen2.5, Qwen3, and Olmo3).\nWe observe that SimpleRL exhibits a clear de-\ncreasing trend in entropy as training proceeds,\nindicating that the policy becomes increasingly de-\nterministic and the exploration space gradually col-\nlapses. In contrast, our uniqueness-aware train-\ning maintains a higher and more stable entropy\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "0\n64\n128\n192\n256\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nAccuracy Pass@k (%)\n(a) Math (AIME)\nSimpleRL\nInstruct\nOurs\n0\n64\n128\n192\n256\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nAccuracy Pass@k (%)\n(b) Math (HLE)\nSimpleRL\nInstruct\nOurs\n0\n64\n128\n192\n256\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nAccuracy Pass@k (%)\n(c) Physics (OlympiadBench)\nSimpleRL\nInstruct\nOurs\n0\n64\n128\n192\n256\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nAccuracy Pass@k (%)\n(d) Medicine (MedCaseReasoning)\nSimpleRL\nInstruct\nOurs\nFigure 2: Pass@k accuracy on math, physics, and medicine benchmarks.\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n200\nTraining Step\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\nactor/entropy_loss\nQwen2.5\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n200\nTraining Step\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.20\n0.22\n0.24\n0.26\nQwen3\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n200\nTraining Step\n4.6\n4.8\n5.0\n5.2\n5.4\n5.6\n5.8\n6.0\n6.2\nOlmo3\nOurs\nSimpleRL(GRPO)\nFigure 3: Entropy dynamics under RL.

This behavior aligns with the\nimprovements in cover@n and diversity coverage:\nby explicitly rewarding unique solution ideas, the\npolicy continues to search for long-tail strategies\neven in later stages of optimization.\n4.4\nHuman Solution Coverage and Creativity\nvia cover@n\nTo rigorously evaluate the diversity of reasoning\npaths, we introduce cover@n, which measures the\nextent to which a model explores the strategy cov-\nerage of valid problem-solving methods. We define\ncover@n as the recall rate of distinct, canonical hu-\nman reference solutions within the top n sampled\nrollouts. Formally, let SGT be the set of ground-\ntruth human solution methods for a given problem,\nand Smodel@n be the set of distinct correct methods\nrecovered by the model in n generations; then\ncover@n = |Smodel ∩SGT |\n|SGT |\n.\n(8)\nA higher cover@n indicates that the model not\nonly solves the problem but also masters a more di-\nverse portfolio of approaches, effectively avoiding\nmode collapse. For empirical analysis, we per-\nform a human evaluation on 20 challenging AIME\n2024/2025 problems. For each problem, we collect\nmultiple human solution write-ups from textbooks,\nofficial/contest solution notes, and online reposito-\nries (typically 3–5 per problem). Because differ-\nent sources often present the same underlying idea\nwith superficial variations, we manually normalize\nthese write-ups into a set of canonical methods\nSGT by: (i) extracting the high-level strategy (e.g.,\ninvariant, recursion, generating function, symme-\ntry/coordinate transform), and (ii) merging solu-\ntions that share the same core reasoning plan de-\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Problem A: GEOMETRIC \nCONSTRUCTION(TANGENTS & CHORDS)\nProblem B: \nCOMBINATIONAL GRID COLORING\nProblem C: \nPROBABILITY & ORDERING\nProblem: Triangle ABC in circle w.\nTangents at B, C intersect at D.

The\nbaseline instruct model (blue dashed) concentrates on standard, low-complexity approaches, while our trained\nmodel (red solid) expands the explored region to recover rarer, higher-insight strategies (e.g., Symmedian Similarity;\ntrail/flow viewpoints).\nspite different manipulations. To obtain Smodel@n,\nwe sample n rollouts and keep only correct ones.\nWe then map each correct rollout to one canonical\nmethod in SGT if its reasoning trace follows the\nsame high-level strategy (rather than matching low-\nlevel steps). Multiple rollouts mapped to the same\ncanonical method are counted once. We deem a\nmethod covered if at least one rollout is mapped to\nit, and compute cover@n accordingly.\nIn what follows, we report results for Qwen2.5\ninstruct model training with our approach, and\ncompare against initial Qwen2.5 instruct models.\nAcross 20 problems, the Qwen2.5 instruct base-\nline and our trained model match method coverage\non 16, while on the remaining 4 most complex\nproblems our model consistently achieved higher\ncoverage. The baseline never led on any individ-\nual problem. Our method improved cover@32 on\n4 problems. For instance, on the geometry prob-\nlem aime24_i_p10 (Notion of the problem. We\nattach the problem and corresponding solutions\nin Appendix C.1), the baseline reaches only 40%\ncover@32 (2/5 canonical ideas), covering Power of\nPoint & Cosine Law and Ptolemy & Chord Ratio,\nwhereas our method achieves full 100% coverage\nby recovering all five human-referenced ideas (in-\ncluding rarer ones such as Symmedian Similarity\nand Pure Trigonometry). On the combinatorics\nproblem aime2025_ii_p3 (Notion of the problem.\nWe attach the problem and corresponding solutions\nin Appendix C.2), the baseline covers only the Bi-\nnary Constraint Formulation (25% = 1/4), while\nour method reaches 75% cover@32 (3/4) by ad-\nditionally recovering Interior-Segments Casework\nand the Trail/Flow Viewpoint, but not the Dynamic\nProgramming strategy.\nFigure 4 provides a qualitative view of this ef-\nfect: in a 2D projection where nodes denote hu-\nman ideas, the baseline clusters around dominant\n“standard” strategies, whereas our model spans a\nbroader frontier and covers tail methods that re-\nquire deeper insight (e.g., Symmedian Similarity\nor max-of-mins style counting).\n5\nConclusion\nWe introduced Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement\nLearning, a simple yet effective approach for mit-\nigating exploration collapse in RL-trained LLMs\nby directly operating at the level of solution strate-\ngies. By reweighting policy updates to favor correct\nbut rare reasoning paths within each problem, our\nmethod aligns reinforcement learning with the prac-\ntical objective of discovering diverse, high-quality\nsolutions rather than optimizing a single dominant\nmode. Empirical results across multiple domains\nand model families show consistent improvements\nin pass@k, entropy dynamics, and coverage of\ncanonical human solution strategies. These find-\nings highlight the importance of treating reasoning\ndiversity as a set-level property and suggest that\nexplicitly modeling solution-strategy uniqueness is\na promising direction for scaling RL toward more\nrobust and creative reasoning systems.\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "Limitations\nOur approach relies on an LLM-based judge to\nidentify and cluster solution strategies, which intro-\nduces additional computational overhead and may\nbe imperfect, particularly on problems with am-\nbiguous or overlapping reasoning structures. The\ndefinition of a “high-level strategy” is inherently\ntask-dependent, and although our prompting miti-\ngates sensitivity to surface variation, misclusterings\nmay affect the accuracy of the uniqueness signal.\nMoreover, our method measures rarity only within\nthe rollout set of a single problem and does not ex-\nplicitly capture long-term novelty or cross-problem\ndiversity during training. Extending uniqueness-\naware objectives to more efficient, globally consis-\ntent, or judge-free formulations remains an impor-\ntant direction for future work.\nReferences\nMinghan Chen, Guikun Chen, Wenguan Wang, and\nYi Yang. 2025a.

Symmedian Similarity (tail method: “Sym-\nmedian Similarity”). Let M be the midpoint\nof BC.

The Three\nTangents Lemma implies that MB and MC are\ntangents to the circumcircle of △ABC, hence\nM coincides with the tangent intersection D.\nSo D is the midpoint of EF.\nNow compute AD by relating △ABC and\n△AEF.

Find the number of such colorings.\nAnswer.\n82 .\nHuman-referenced solution ideas (4, with full\nderivations).\n1. Binary constraint formulation. Let each unit\nedge e be a variable xe ∈{0, 1} (red = 1, blue\n= 0). Each small unit square Q imposes\nX\ne⊂Q\nxe = 2.\n(⋆)\nThere are four interior edges: two interior ver-\ntical edges and two interior horizontal edges.\nCondition on the interior assignment. Then for\neach unit square, two of its four edges are in-\nterior; thus the sum of the other two boundary\nedges is forced by (⋆). So each interior pat-\ntern yields a finite (small) number of boundary\ncompletions.\nWe classify by k = number of red interior\nedges.\nCase k = 0.\nAll interior edges are blue. Then\nevery square has 0 red contributed internally,\n"}, {"page": 25, "text": "so both of its boundary edges must be red. This\nforces all boundary edges uniquely. Count = 1.\nCase k = 4.\nAll interior edges are red. Then\nevery square already has 2 reds internally, so\nall boundary edges are forced blue. Count = 1.\nCase k = 1.\nChoose the unique red interior\nedge: 4 choices. Fix one choice. Exactly two\nsquares are incident to that interior edge; in\neach such square, the two boundary edges must\ncontain exactly one red (since internal contri-\nbution is 1). The remaining two squares have\ninternal contribution 0, so both their boundary\nedges are red. Walking around the perimeter,\nthe shared boundary constraints force a con-\nsistent completion with exactly 4 possibilities\n(corresponding to the free choice of one bound-\nary edge on the side adjacent to the red interior).\nThus count = 4 · 4 = 16.\nCase k = 3.\nBy swapping red/blue on ev-\nery edge, configurations with k = 1 biject to\nconfigurations with k = 3. So count = 16.\nCase k = 2.\nTwo subcases:\n(i) Opposite interior edges red. There are 2\npatterns (both vertical interior edges red, or\nboth horizontal interior edges red). For each\npattern, the boundary system has 16 solutions\n(a small check: two independent binary choices\nremain). Contribution 2 · 16 = 32.\n(ii) Adjacent interior edges red. There are 4\nL-shaped patterns. For each pattern, the bound-\nary completion has 4 solutions (one effective\nbinary decision plus symmetry). Contribution\n4 · 4 = 16.\nSo k = 2 contributes 32 + 16 = 48.\nSumming:\n1 + 16 + 48 + 16 + 1 = 82 .\n2. Interior segments casework. Name the four\ninterior edges as vt, vb (the two interior ver-\ntical segments) and hℓ, hr (the two interior\nhorizontal segments). We again case on k =\n#{red among vt, vb, hℓ, hr}, but we present it\npurely as a direct interior-pattern enumeration.\nCases k = 0 and k = 4.\nForced completions\nas above; total 1 + 1.\nCase k = 1 (and k = 3).\nThere are 4\nchoices for the unique red interior edge. Fix\none. Then two squares have interior contribu-\ntion 1 and therefore require exactly one red\namong their two boundary edges, while the\nother two squares require both boundary edges\nred (or both blue in the k = 3 case). The\nperimeter constraints propagate; a quick forced\nwalk shows exactly 4 completions per fixed in-\nterior choice. Thus k = 1 contributes 16 and\nk = 3 contributes 16.\nCase k = 2.\nOpposite patterns: 2 choices,\neach yields 16 completions ⇒32. Adjacent\npatterns: 4 choices, each yields 4 completions\n⇒16. So k = 2 contributes 48.\nTherefore the total is 82 .\n3. Trail/flow viewpoint. Interpret red edges as\n“active”. The rule “each unit square has exactly\ntwo red sides” means in each unit square, the\nred edges form a degree-2 pattern: either a\nstraight segment (opposite sides red) or a turn\n(adjacent sides red). Hence each cell locally\nbehaves like a path piece.\nThe four interior edges determine how these\nlocal path pieces must connect across shared\nsides. Enumerate by k (red interior edges):\n• k = 0: no interior connections; every cell\nmust use its boundary edges as the two reds.\nGlobally forced ⇒1.\n• k = 4: every cell uses its two interior sides\nas reds, forcing all boundary edges blue\n⇒1.\n• k = 1 and k = 3: a single interior con-\nnection creates a unique “mismatch” that\nforces a perimeter pattern, leaving 4 com-\npletions per placement ⇒16 each.\n• k = 2: opposite interior connections give\n32 completions; adjacent ones give 16 com-\npletions.\nSumming again yields 82 .\n4. Dynamic Programming (transfer-matrix /\nDP over boundary states).\nWe outline a\nstandard DP that counts colorings by sweep-\ning left-to-right. Represent the colors of the\ntwo interior vertical edges (the interface be-\ntween the two columns) as a 2-bit state s ∈\n{00, 01, 10, 11} (top to bottom, 1 = red).\n"}, {"page": 26, "text": "One can compute, for each s, the number of\nvalid completions of the left column that satisfy\n“two red per square” and match the interface\nstate. Do the same for the right column, then\ncombine with a refined state that also tracks the\ntwo interior horizontal edges, yielding a small\nfinite transfer matrix. Carrying out this enumer-\nation produces the same interior-count distri-\nbution 1, 16, 48, 16, 1 across k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\nand thus 82 .\n"}]}
