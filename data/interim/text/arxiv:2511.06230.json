During hospitalization, rich diagnostic, \nlaboratory, and treatment information is continuously recorded in electronic health rec-\nords (EHRs). These records provide valuable real-world data for developing precise \nand intelligent discharge medication recommendation systems that can assist clinicians \nin optimizing personalized treatment strategies [1-3].  \nIn recent years, drug recommendation has received increasing research attention, \nwith most studies primarily focusing on English-language datasets such as MIMIC-III \n[4] and MIMIC-IV [5]. Despite the growing research interest, there remains a lack of \nstandardized shared tasks for drug recommendation based on real-world EHR data. In \nparticular, research and evaluation efforts based on Chinese clinical data are still in their \nearly stages. Publicly available benchmark datasets and standardized evaluation criteria \nare essential to ensure fair comparisons across different approaches. Therefore, we or-\nganized the discharge medication recommendation task for metabolic diseases based \non Chinese EHRs at the China Health Information Processing Conference (CHIP), aim-\ning to promote research on intelligent medication recommendation in real-world Chi-\nnese healthcare settings [6]. As shown in Fig. 1, the task involves inputting de-identi-\nfied inpatient Chinese EHR texts into the models to automatically recommend drugs \nselected from a predefined candidate list. \n \n \nFig. 1.

In this paper, the \nfollowing sections first review related work, then provide a detailed description of the \ndataset construction, task definition and evaluation metric. Subsequently, we analyze \nthe key methods adopted by the top-performing teams and their results, and finally pre-\nsent a summary and outlook for this evaluation. \n2 \nRelated Work \nTo promote the development of artificial intelligence technologies in the biomedical \ndomain, a growing number of challenge evaluations have been organized, such as Bi-\noCreative2, China Conference on Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing (CCKS) \n[7], China National Conference on Computational Linguistics (CCL), and CHIP. Alt-\nhough many of these evaluations are held annually and cover a wide range of biomed-\nical topics, tasks specifically targeting medication recommendation remain relatively \nscarce. Recently, Task 9 of CCL25-Eval3 has focused on the core challenges of syn-\ndrome differentiation and herbal prescription generation in Traditional Chinese Medi-\ncine. Given clinical symptom descriptions as input, participants are required to generate \npersonalized herbal prescriptions. In contrast, our task centers on modern medicine, \ntargeting discharge medication recommendation for metabolic diseases based on real \nelectronic medical records. Moreover, our evaluation is supported by a larger, high-\nquality dataset, enabling more comprehensive benchmarking and facilitating the devel-\nopment of robust, data-driven medication recommendation models. \nWith the continuous development of large language models (LLMs) [8-12], their \napplications in the healthcare have expanded rapidly, leading to the emergence of nu-\nmerous medical LLMs [13-15]. These models are typically trained on medical corpora \nand have achieved strong performance across various benchmark tasks [16-18]. For \nexample, Med-PaLM 2 [19] integrates large-scale, high-quality medical data with \nmulti-stage instruction fine-tuning to enhance capabilities in medical question answer-\ning, clinical reasoning, medical knowledge retrieval, and professional text generation. \nIn the Chinese medical context, LLMs such as HuatuoGPT-o1 [20] have been devel-\noped for complex medical reasoning tasks. HuatuoGPT-o1 is trained on a dataset of \n40,000 verifiable medical questions and employing a medical verifier to evaluate output \nquality, thereby enabling quantifiable optimization of reasoning pathways. \nIn recent years, a growing number of open-source medical datasets have also been \nreleased [21-24], most of which serve as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of \nmedical LLMs. Research on discharge medication recommendation heavily relies on \nopen EHR and clinical text data for model training and validation [25-27]. Among these \ndatasets [4,5,28], the MIMIC series [4,5] from Beth Israel Hospital is one of the most \n \n2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/biocreative \n3 https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532301 \n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "4  \nJ.

However, most existing datasets for drug rec-\nommendation are based on English-language data, and Chinese datasets remain scarce. \nThe DAILMED dataset [29], which adopts a dialogue-based paradigm for medication \nrecommendation, is among of the few available Chinese datasets in this field. There-\nfore, we introduce CDrugRed [30], the Chinese discharge medication recommendation \ndataset focusing on metabolic diseases. This dataset provides a valuable foundation for \ndeveloping and evaluating intelligent medication recommendation systems tailored to \nChinese clinical practice. \n3 \nMaterial and Methods \n3.1 \nTask Definition \nIn this shared task, the systems of participating teams are required to predict a set of \ndischarge medications for patients with metabolic diseases  based on de-identified Chi-\nnese EHR texts. The recommended medications must be selected from a predefined \ncandidate drug list. The input to the model consists of the patient’s inpatient records, \nand the output is a patient-specific list of medications that would be appropriately pre-\nscribed at discharge. Participants were encouraged to explore diverse technical solu-\ntions, including traditional machine learning, deep learning, pretrained language mod-\nels, or retrieval-augmented generation methods. To ensure fairness and reproducibility, \nthe task imposed certain constraints: 1) The total model size was limited to 10 billion \nparameters; 2) The use of external resources or knowledge bases was permitted only if \ntheir sources were explicitly declared. These standardized requirements aimed to pro-\nmote methodological innovation while maintaining the integrity and comparability of \nsystem performance across participating teams. \n \n3.2 \nDataset Description \nThe evaluation was conducted using the CDrugRed dataset [30], a new Chinese dis-\ncharge medication recommendation dataset focused on metabolic diseases. This dataset \nwas developed to facilitate research on intelligent and interpretable clinical medication \nrecommendation. CDrugRed is constructed from real electronic medical records col-\nlected at a top-tier tertiary hospital in China, covering 5,894 de-identified hospitaliza-\ntion records from 3,190 patients spanning the years 2013 and 2023. The dataset includes \n651 candidate drugs and provides rich clinical information, including basic demo-\ngraphic data, admission conditions, inpatient clinical course, laboratory and examina-\ntion results, past medical history, discharge diagnoses, and actual discharge medica-\ntions prescribed by physicians. An example is shown in Table 1. To protect patient \nprivacy and ensure data quality, the dataset underwent a multi-stage processing pipeline \ninvolving large-model-assisted de-identification, standardized drug-name normaliza-\ntion, and manual review to ensure data security and consistency with clinical terminol-\nogy. \n \n"}, {"page": 5, "text": " \nOverview of CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 \n5 \nTable 1.

At the data rep-\nresentation level, they introduced drug category annotations, explicit patient meta-fea-\ntures, and disease–drug co-occurrence knowledge to enhance clinical semantic under-\nstanding. They also applied order perturbations to diagnostic and medication lists to \nimprove model robustness and generalization. At the model level, they performed full \nsupervised fine-tuning based on the Qwen-series LLMs and adopted differentiated \ntraining strategies for models of different parameter sizes to obtain complementary en-\nsembles. During inference, a hierarchical weighted-voting fusion mechanism was in-\ntroduced, assigning adaptive weights based on validation performance to balance bias \nand variance across model predictions. \nTeam ZZUNLP (Zhengzhou University) \nThe ZZUNLP team developed a systematic solution across the dimensions of data, \nmodel training, and inference. To address the domain specificity of medical text and \nthe scarcity of labeled data, they designed prompt templates tailored for clinical medi-\ncation reasoning and introduced a pseudo-labeling data-augmentation strategy. They \nused the cross-entropy loss of label sequences as a confidence indicator to filter high-\nquality pseudo-labeled samples. Multiple open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using \nLoRA and optimized with the liger-kernel cross-entropy loss for efficient memory uti-\nlization. For inference, they employed a two-stage hierarchical ensemble: in stage one, \nweighted voting was applied separately within model groups trained on original data \nand augmented data to obtain high-confidence predictions; in stage two, an adaptive \nfusion strategy based on differences in predicted list length and Jaccard similarity fur-\nther improved final recommendation performance. \nTeam suxiao818 (MISUMI (China) Precision Machinery Trading Co., Ltd.) \nThe suxiao818 team implemented a fine-tuning and ensemble-based framework built \nupon multiple LLMs. They split the dataset (9:1) into training and validation subsets \nand selected the top-performing four models with LoRA fine-tuning for ensemble. To \nmitigate randomness in generative decoding, each model produced multiple predictions \nunder different decoding temperatures, which were fused using majority voting.

Low-relevance fields (such as patient index, gen-\nder, BMI) were removed, and samples containing rare drugs were duplicated or tripli-\ncated based on frequency thresholds. To increase data diversity, they introduced order-\nshuffled samples and combined them with the oversampled set, resulting in 6,740 aug-\nmented samples. Five open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using LoRA on these da-\ntasets. During inference, fuzzy string matching normalized predicted drugs to the can-\ndidate list, supplemented by a manually curated alias mapping table.

The high level of participation and diverse system designs reflect strong com-\nmunity engagement and the growing interest in data-driven clinical decision support. \nThe top-performing teams demonstrated that ensemble frameworks combining domain-\nspecific fine-tuned LLMs can effectively leverage EHR information to improve dis-\ncharge medication prediction. This shared task provides valuable insights into the prac-\ntical application of NLP and machine learning for personalized medication manage-\nment, contributing to the advancement of precision medicine in chronic metabolic care.  \nDespite these advances, challenges remain in addressing label imbalance, rare med-\nication usage, and generalizing across institutions. For future work, we plan to expand \nthe dataset with additional clinical contexts from multiple institutions, incorporating \nmulti-modal data such as laboratory and medical imaging, and moving beyond drug \nname recommendation to generating complete medication regimens, including dosage \nand instructions. These efforts aim to promote explainable and trustworthy AI systems \nfor clinical medication applications.  \n \nAcknowledgments.
