While the clinical community has long sought\nmethods for early prediction, progress has been severely limited by\na fundamental data paradox: patients typically present to the hos-\npital only post-onset[47]. Consequently, standard clinical datasets\n∗Corresponding Author\nKDD ’26, Jeju, Korea\n2026.\ncontain abundant post-stroke data but suffer from a complete ab-\nsence of pre-stroke physiological signals[21]. This \"blind spot\" has\nprecluded the validation of continuous monitoring technologies,\nsuch as Photoplethysmography (PPG), for effective stroke predic-\ntion prior to onset[22].\nFrom a biomedical engineering perspective, PPG is theoretically\nan ideal candidate for this task[61]. Stroke is driven by cerebrovas-\ncular hemodynamics—specifically, abrupt changes in vascular re-\nsistance and blood flow dynamics[43]. As PPG passively measures\nperipheral blood volume changes, it offers a direct window into\nthe systemic cardiovascular state. However, the efficacy of PPG for\nstroke prediction remains an unproven hypothesis[56, 59], primar-\nily attributable to the historical paucity of data documenting the\nphysiological transition from a baseline state to an acute stroke\nevent[7, 8, 26].\nIn this work, we overcome this barrier by targeting a unique and\nchallenging cohort: in-hospital stroke patients. These are patients\nwho were already under continuous physiological monitoring for\nother conditions when they suffered a stroke. This rare scenario\noffers a unique opportunity to capture \"pre-stroke\" waveform data\nunavailable in standard admission records. By retrospectively ana-\nlyzing these cases, we can—for the first time—explore the feasibility\nof PPG-based early warning systems using real-world clinical data.\nTo operationalize this, we utilized two large-scale datasets, MIMIC-\nIII [40] and MC-MED [29]. However, identifying these rare cases\npresents a significant mining challenge. The timestamps available\nin structured EHR data represent documentation time rather than\nthe physiological onset of stroke, and therefore cannot be directly\ninterpreted as onset time. To address this, we developed a pipeline\nusing Gemini 3 Pro to extract exact onset timestamps from un-\nstructured clinical notes, which were subsequently validated by\nphysicians. This rigorous process allowed us to identify 176 patients\nin MIMIC-III and 158 patients in MC-MED who possess high-quality,\nsynchronized PPG waveforms leading up to the event.\nWith this unprecedented data, we developed a deep learning\nframework to test our hypothesis. Hemodynamic features extracted\nfrom pre-onset PPG signals were fed into a ResNet-1D model to iden-\ntify predictive signatures[23, 50, 55]. Across three early-warning\nhorizons, the model demonstrates progressively improved perfor-\nmance. When trained and validated on the internal MIMIC-III co-\nhort, F1-scores increase from 0.7956 at 4 hours to 0.8759 ± 0.0105\nat 5 hours and 0.9406 at 6 hours prior to onset. Using the same\ntrained model without any re-tuning, external evaluation on the\nMC-MED cohort yields F1-scores of 0.9256, 0.9595, and 0.9888 for\nthe corresponding horizons. These results confirm the validity of\nPPG as a predictive signal for early stroke warning and demonstrate\nthat temporally aligned, passively acquired physiological data can\narXiv:2602.09328v1  [cs.LG]  10 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "KDD ’26, August 2026, Jeju, Korea\nLiu et al.\nsupport reliable prediction with substantial lead time, beyond what\nis achievable through model-centric optimization alone.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nStroke Prediction with EHR and ML\nTraditional stroke stratification has evolved from rule-based scoring\n(e.g., Framingham) to high-dimensional modeling using EHR[1, 2,\n12, 41, 54]. While early ML approaches (e.g., Random Forests, SVMs)\neffectively leveraged structured features like demographics and\ndiagnosis codes for population-level risk assessment [10, 20, 24, 25,\n34, 37, 46, 49, 52, 60], they rely on static snapshots.\nThese methods inherently lack the temporal granularity required\nfor acute, real-time physiological monitoring in clinical settings.\n2.2\nOccult Disease Detection via Physio-Signals\nAddressing EHR limitations, Deep Learning (DL) architectures now\nenable the identification of occult disease signatures from continu-\nous physiological signals, even absent explicit pathological events\n[5, 30, 39, 58]. A key area is extracting risk precursors from Normal\nSinus Rhythm in ECGs [28, 32, 45, 65]. Notably, Gadaleta et al. [16]\ndemonstrated that sub-clinical morphological features in AF-free\nintervals could accurately quantify near-term Atrial Fibrillation\nrisk. These findings validate the hypothesis that DL can extract\nlatent morphological biomarkers invisible to standard clinical in-\nterpretation [13, 18, 48, 53].\n2.3\nPPG Hemodynamics and the Label Gap\nPPG offers a complementary window into cerebrovascular hemody-\nnamics, reflecting vascular stiffness and aging [6, 9, 14, 38, 44].\nWhile recent end-to-end DL models successfully infer indirect\nstroke factors (e.g., cuffless blood pressure, AF) from raw pulse\nwaves [35, 42, 62], the direct prediction of acute in-hospital stroke\nremains unexplored [3]. Existing PPG research is predominantly\nretrospective or associative [33, 64], lacking predictive capability\nfor the critical pre-onset window.\nThis gap stems not from sensor limitations, but from a fundamen-\ntal \"label unavailability\" challenge: the scarcity of in-hospital stroke\ndatasets prevents the construction of aligned pre-stroke windows\nfor supervised learning [4, 51]. Our work addresses this bottleneck\nby establishing a reliable temporal reference via an LLM-enhanced\nwaveform anchoring method, enabling the first data-centric explo-\nration of PPG-based acute stroke prediction [57].\n3\nMethods\nTo validate the predictive value of continuous physiological moni-\ntoring for impending stroke, this work utilizes two large-scale criti-\ncal care databases: MIMIC-III [40] as the internal development set\nand MC-MED [29] for external evaluation. The core methodological\nchallenge addressed in this work is the absence of structured times-\ntamps for in-hospital stroke onset in standard EHR. To overcome\nthis, this work establishes a comprehensive data processing pipeline,\nas illustrated in Fig. 1, consisting of three primary stages: (1) Co-\nhort Identification and Temporal Anchoring, where we combine\nICD-based screening with an LLM-assisted extraction workflow to\npinpoint precise stroke onset timestamps from unstructured clinical\nnarratives; (2) Physiological Signal Preprocessing, involving the\nextraction, quality assessment, and windowing of high-frequency\nPPG waveforms aligned to the validated onset times; and (3) Deep\nLearning Modeling, employing a ResNet-1D architecture to capture\nhemodynamic precursors across varying prediction horizons.\n3.1\nData Source\nThis study leverages two distinct large-scale clinical databases to en-\nsure both robust model development and external generalizability:\nthe MIMIC-III [40] and the MC-MED [29].\nMIMIC-III (Internal Cohort): Sourced from the Beth Israel Dea-\nconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, this single-center database\nserves as our primary training and internal validation environment.\nIt comprises comprehensive de-identified health-related data asso-\nciated with over 40,000 patients who stayed in critical care units\nbetween 2001 and 2012. Our analysis focused on the subset of 38,548\npatients for whom sufficient waveform data was potentially retriev-\nable. Within this population, the identified stroke subset exhibited\na mean age of 66.9 years (SD 15.3), notably higher than the overall\ncohort mean of 63.8 years. Racial demographics within the stroke\nsubset largely mirrored the general MIMIC population, with 124\n(70.5%) identified as White, 13 (7.4%) as Black or African American,\nand 5 (2.8%) as Asian. Comorbidity profiles indicated significantly\nhigher rates of hypertension in the stroke group (76.7% vs. 56.8%)\nand hyperlipidemia (39.8% vs. 31.8%), consistent with established\nvascular risk factors.\nMC-MED (External Cohort): To rigorously test model transfer-\nability, we employed MC-MED, a large-scale multi-center database\naggregating EHR and physiological data from diverse hospital sys-\ntems across the West Coast. This dataset provides a substantially\nlarger general pool of 118,385 patients. The confirmed stroke subset\nin MC-MED presented a distinct demographic profile compared to\nMIMIC-III, with a higher mean age of 71.2 years (SD 15.0) versus\nthe general MC-MED population of 53.3 years. The racial composi-\ntion of the stroke subset in MC-MED differed from the internal set,\nwith a larger proportion of Asian patients (45 individuals, 28.5%)\ncompared to White (74 individuals, 46.8%) and Black or African\nAmerican patients (8 individuals, 5.1%).\nAs summarized in Table 1, both stroke subsets consistently\nskewed older and demonstrated a higher burden of vascular comor-\nbidities relative to their respective general populations, reinforcing\nthe clinical validity of the extracted cohorts despite the heterogene-\nity in data sources.\n3.2\nStroke Onset Time Extraction via LLM\nThe main obstacle to training supervised models for acute in-hospital\nstroke lies in the insufficient temporal resolution of the standard\nEHR. While structured data fields reliably identify the occurrence\nof a stroke, they inherently lack the granularity to pinpoint the pre-\ncise moment of symptom onset—a critical variable for defining the\npre-event window. Consequently, the crucial timestamp that marks\nthe physiological transition from baseline to pathology is typically\nembedded within unstructured free-text clinical narratives.\nTo bridge this gap efficiently, we implemented an automated\nNLP pipeline to parse unstructured clinical narratives from MIMIC-\nIII and MC-MED datasets.

First, it prioritizes Explicit Semantic Alignment, scan-\nning for direct temporal markers (e.g., \"onset at 6:30 AM\") and\nresolving relative expressions against the note’s metadata to derive\nan absolute timestamp. In the absence of a specific onset description,\nthe system utilizes an Implicit Temporal Proxy if an acute event is\nconfirmed, defaulting to the note’s creation time as a conservative\nupper bound. Conversely, records describing unrelated patholo-\ngies or historical strokes without acute recurrence are flagged as\nnon-events and excluded.\nThis logic converts unstructured clinical notes into structured\ntemporal indices. We validated this method via a protocol involving\ntwo neurologists. On a stratified subset of 100 cases, the model\nachieved 95.0% concordance within a ±15-minute tolerance of the\nground truth. This tolerance aligns with the labeling strategy de-\ntailed in Section 3.4, which defines the normal, warning, and buffer\nzones for stroke prediction.\n3.3\nHemodynamic Feature Engineering\nBased on the verified stroke onset timestamps, we implemented a\npipeline to derive standardized predictors of acute cerebrovascular\nevents. Utilizing the pyPPG toolbox [19], we extracted 74 morpho-\nlogical biomarkers per cardiac cycle from the raw PPG signal and\nits derivatives to capture hemodynamic dynamics. Recognizing the\nlimitations of absolute physiological measurements due to inter-\npatient heterogeneity, we applied a normalization technique to\nisolate pathological trajectories. Each metric 𝑥(𝑡) was projected\ninto a relative deviation space to quantify the magnitude of di-\nvergence. Consequently, a Relative Displacement score (F𝑟𝑒𝑙) was\ncalculated relative to a subject-specific baseline 𝜇𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒, established\nas the mean value during the initial stable period:\n-480\n(Tw +\npre)\n(Tw\npre)\n0\n0\nNormal\nWarning\nBuffer Time\nLead Time\nStroke Onset\ntt\nFigure 2: Temporal Labeling Strategy.

This\nhierarchy prioritizes patient-specific longitudinal trajectories 𝑅𝑒𝑙\nover static thresholds to isolate acute pathological hardening. The\nmodel also integrates hemodynamic instability markers including\nrelative amplitude deviations 𝐴𝑠𝑝,𝑅𝑒𝑙and pulse timing variability.\nThe prominence of velocity features like 𝑇𝑣in the external cohort\nfurther confirms sensitivity to cardiac ejection efficiency degrada-\ntion.\nWe mapped the temporal evolution of high-impact features in\nFig. 5 to validate dynamic consistency. A distinct physiological\ndivergence appears in the critical warning zone. The leading pre-\ndictor, Relative Systolic Peak Time (𝑇𝑠𝑝,𝑅𝑒𝑙), exhibits a progressive\nupward drift. Conversely, absolute Systolic Peak Time (𝑇𝑠𝑝) and\nstroke volume proxies (𝐴𝑠𝑝,𝑅𝑒𝑙) display a synchronized decline. This\ninverse relationship connects rising systolic timing deviations with\ndampening hemodynamic force. These patterns confirm that high\nSHAP scores correspond to tangible pre-stroke decompensation\nand reinforce clinical validity.\n4.3\nStratified Performance Evaluation\nWe evaluated generalizability using the external MC-MED cohort\nas depicted in Fig. 6. We assessed whether models trained on the\npredominantly White MIMIC-III population propagate bias to het-\nerogeneous datasets. The model maintains high utility across racial\ngroups with F1-scores of 0.944 for Black and 0.956 for White cohorts.\nPerformance variances are statistically significant at 𝑝< 0.001 but\nabsolute scores remain high. The model generalizes to the Asian\ncohort with an F1-score of 0.921 despite limited training data. This\nconsistency suggests extracted PPG precursors capture physiologi-\ncal features invariant to race. Female patients exhibit slightly higher\nperformance with an F1-score of 0.958 compared to 0.950 for males.\nWe further examined five comorbidities associated with vascular\nstiffness defined by specific ICD diagnostic codes. These conditions\ninclude Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Hyperlipidemia, Chronic\nKidney Disease, and Ischemic Heart Disease. We categorized pa-\ntients into a Low Risk group with zero comorbidities, a Medium Risk\ngroup with one to two, and a High Risk group with three or more.\nPerformance remains strong across strata despite a slight decrease\nrelative to the baseline. F1-scores are 0.968 for Low Risk, 0.943 for\nMedium Risk, and 0.946 for High Risk groups. F1-scores above 0.94\nin complex pathology confirm clinical utility. Performance attenu-\nates in the Elderly cohort aged 65 and older with an F1-score of 0.938\ncompared to 0.981 in Non-Elderly patients. This significant drop\nat 𝑝< 0.001 likely results from arterial stiffness masking hemody-\nnamic signals. High performance confirms effective generalization\nagainst vascular aging and chronic comorbidities.\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "KDD ’26, August 2026, Jeju, Korea\nLiu et al.\nTable 2: Performance comparison of the same ResNet-1D model selection protocol under different early-warning windows on\ninternal (MIMIC) and external (MC-MED) validation cohorts.

Relative Systolic Peak Time (𝑇𝑠𝑝,𝑅𝑒𝑙) dominates prediction across cohorts, followed by\n𝐶𝑉𝑇,𝑝𝑖and 𝐴𝑠𝑝,𝑅𝑒𝑙. (SHAP values scaled by 103).\n5\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates that stroke, traditionally regarded as an\nabrupt and clinically silent event until symptom onset, is preceded\nby detectable physiological alterations measurable through continu-\nous bedside monitoring. By leveraging PPG signals acquired during\nroutine inpatient care, we show that meaningful hemodynamic\nsignatures emerge several hours before clinically recognized stroke\nonset. Following are several key clinical discussion points.\nHemodynamic Timing Signatures Preceding In-Hospital\nStroke. A key physiological insight from this study is the consistent\ninvolvement of two PPG-derived systolic timing features—Systolic\nRise Time (SRT) and Time to Maximum Velocity (TMV)—as early\nindicators of stroke risk. SRT reflects arterial compliance and wave\nreflection, while TMV, defined by the peak of the first derivative of\nthe PPG waveform, captures early systolic acceleration and ventric-\nular–vascular coupling. SHAP analysis confirms that both features\nare among the dominant contributors to model predictions across\ninternal and external cohorts, indicating reliance on fundamen-\ntal hemodynamic mechanisms rather than site-specific artifacts.\nTheir temporal trajectories demonstrate progressive deviation from\npatient-specific baselines in the hours preceding stroke, suggesting\na gradual loss of systolic efficiency and arterial buffering capacity.\nFrom a cardiovascular perspective, these findings imply that stroke\nonset is preceded by systemic hemodynamic deterioration, in which\nimpaired flow acceleration and altered pulse propagation increase\ncerebrovascular vulnerability.\nClinical Generalizability and Demographic Equity. To as-\nsess clinical generalizability, we evaluated the proposed model\nacross diverse demographics and distributional shifts. The model\nmaintained statistical invariance across multi-ethnic cohorts and\nvarious comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and renal dis-\nease), suggesting that predictive signatures rely on universal hemo-\ndynamic mechanisms rather than demographic artifacts or sensor-\ninduced biases like skin pigmentation. Although geriatric vascular\nremodeling and arterial stiffness may slightly dampen acute signal\ndetection, individualized baselines preserve clinical efficacy and pre-\ndictive accuracy. The model demonstrated distributional robustness\nwith superior F1-scores during external validation (Table 2), par-\ntially attributable to saturated anomaly ratios (91.31%–99.74%) [15]\nin the external cohort. This generalization is further corroborated\nby the consistent discriminative performance maintained across co-\nhorts, confirming the extraction of domain-invariant hemodynamic\nfeatures.\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "In-Hospital Stroke Prediction from PPG\nKDD ’26, August 2026, Jeju, Korea\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nStroke Onset\nNormalized Hemodynamic Feature Trajectories\nTsp, Rel (HRV)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nTsp \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nTime (h)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nAsp, Rel (Stroke Volume)\nNormal\nBuffer\nWarning\nTimes(h)\n(Transmission)\n(Ejection Velocity)\nFigure 5: Trajectories of Leading Contributing Factors.

A central clinical implication of this study is the demonstra-\ntion that stroke may be physiologically detectable several hours\nbefore overt neurological deterioration, using signals that are al-\nready routinely collected in hospitalized patients. Traditionally,\nstroke diagnosis and intervention are triggered only after the ap-\npearance of focal neurological deficits, at which point irreversible\nbrain injury may have already occurred. Our findings suggest that\ncontinuous PPG monitoring contains hemodynamic signatures that\nprecede clinically recognized stroke by up to six hours, defining a\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "KDD ’26, August 2026, Jeju, Korea\nLiu et al.\npreviously unrecognized pre-onset window that may be amenable\nto proactive clinical response. From a clinical standpoint, such an\nearly warning signal does not aim to replace neurological exami-\nnation or imaging-based diagnosis, but rather to function as a risk\nstratification and surveillance trigger. Patients flagged as high risk\ncould undergo intensified neurological observation, expedited neu-\nroimaging, tighter blood pressure and hemodynamic control, or\nearlier specialist consultation. Importantly, even modest delays in\nstroke recognition are known to worsen outcomes; therefore, shift-\ning clinical attention several hours earlier—even without definitive\ndiagnosis—has the potential to materially improve patient trajecto-\nries by reducing time-to-intervention once symptoms emerge.\nLimitations and Future Work. Despite the robust performance\nof the framework, several limitations remain. First, the current\nmodel lacks the granularity to stratify stroke by subtype, etiology,\nor severity due to the limited sample size of precisely annotated\nin-hospital cases. Future research requires larger, prospectively cu-\nrated datasets to move toward patient-tailored warning systems.\nSecond, while stroke serves as a proof-of-concept, the identified\nhemodynamic features—such as arterial stiffness and pulse tim-\ning—reflect systemic vascular dynamics rather than stroke-specific\npathology. This suggests a broad potential for extending this PPG-\nbased framework to other acute conditions involving hemodynamic\ndeterioration, such as sepsis or acute heart failure. Finally, the ret-\nrospective nature of this study necessitates prospective validation\nin real-time clinical workflows to evaluate its actual impact on\ndecision-making and patient outcomes. Integrating these alerts\nrequires a careful balance between diagnostic sensitivity and the\npractical management of alert burden at the bedside.\n6\nConclusion\nThis work bridges the critical \"blind spot\" in acute care informatics\nby introducing an LLM-Enhanced Waveform Anchoring frame-\nwork, which successfully transforms unstructured clinical narra-\ntives into precisely aligned physiological datasets. By unlocking the\nlatent predictive value of continuous PPG signals in confirmed in-\nhospital stroke cases, our data-centric approach demonstrates that\nperipheral hemodynamics harbor actionable warning signatures\nwell before onset. Specifically, utilizing a ResNet-1D architecture,\nthe proposed model achieves a clinically significant 6-hour lead\ntime on the internal MIMIC-III cohort with an F1-score of 0.9406\nand exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to the external\nMC-MED cohort, attaining an F1-score of 0.9888 without retrain-\ning. These findings validate the feasibility of passive, non-invasive\nmonitoring for early stroke detection, marking a pivotal shift from\nreactive diagnosis to data-driven, proactive prevention in clinical\nsettings.\nGenerative AI Declaration\nThis work utilized Gemini 3 Pro (Google) for two specific tasks.\nData Extraction: The model parsed stroke timestamps from un-\nstructured clinical notes.
