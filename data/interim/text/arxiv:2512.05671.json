Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated ex-\ntraordinary capabilities on tasks requiring deep knowledge\nand complex reasoning (OpenAI, 2025; Google, 2025; Guo\net al., 2025). They are evolving beyond passive tools to\nbecome active collaborators with the potential to provide\npersonalized guidance (Zhang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024;\nGao et al., 2025; Dinucu-Jianu et al., 2025; He et al., 2025b).\nThis potential is particularly relevant to medical education,\nwhich has long faced the challenge of a noticeable gap be-\ntween the availability of high-quality clinical instruction\nand the growing demand for training (Ende, 1983; Okuda\net al., 2009; Safranek et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024; Arana\net al., 2025). Expert scarcity limits high-quality teaching,\nespecially in under-resourced regions. Therefore, low-cost,\nprofessional-grade AI tutors are a promising solution to\nadvance medical education.\nResearch in this domain generally falls into two categories:\n(1) raw data-driven methods, which train a tutor by col-\nlecting large-scale educational data from textbooks, such\nas EduChat (Dan et al., 2023). These methods are lim-\nited by costly data construction and static, unidirectional\ninteractions. (2) simulation-driven methods, which build\nthe teaching process through multi-agent simulation. For\nexample, SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024), trained on Dean-\nTeacher-Student pipeline with objective questions, cannot\nhandle dynamic patient cases or complex clinical reasoning.\nMEDCO (Wei et al., 2024) extends this by creating a multi-\nagent environment with a patient and a radiologist, enabling\nrepeated case simulations for student. While existing AI\ntutors excel at one-on-one knowledge instruction, they ne-\nglect collaborative reasoning—a core clinical skill fostered\nin group settings such as ward rounds (Wershofen et al.,\n2016; Le et al., 2024). This pedagogical process aims to\nguide joint reasoning and cultivate teamwork, a higher-order\nability beyond simple knowledge transmission.\nTo create a controllable testbed for this ward round pedagogi-\ncal process, we develop ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagogical\nsimulator. ClinEdu populates its scenarios with personality-\ndriven agents and student cohorts from diverse medical\nbackgrounds, shifting the core challenge from solving ob-\njective problems to navigating the nuances of interactive\n1\narXiv:2512.05671v1  [cs.CL]  5 Dec 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nclinical reasoning, which requires the AI tutor to provide\nprecise and high-order Socratic guidance within chaotic and\nsubjective information streams. Built on our simulation\nenvironment, we construct ClinTeach, a dataset contain-\ning 48K Socratic teaching dialogues that captures the com-\nplexities of group instruction. Notably, teaching multiple\nstudents in clinical settings is significantly more complex\nthan one-on-one instruction, as the teacher must operate\nwithin a larger strategy space. Therefore, in each dialogue\nround, the AI tutor is required to organize its thinking with\n<think history> for the dialogue history, <think question>\nfor the current question, <think student> for individual stu-\ndents, and <think group> for the student group before pro-\nviding guidance. This approach enables teachers to reflect\non students’ overall reasoning progress while designing per-\nsonalized instructional strategies for each student, balancing\ngroup and individual needs for more efficient and precise\nSocratic teaching. Then, we train MedTutor-R1 based on\nour ClinTeach dataset, the first multimodal Socratic tutor\ndesigned for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical\neducation. After instruction fine-tuning to establish internal\nthought processes and basic teaching skills, we employ rein-\nforcement learning with rewards derived from a three-axis\nrubric covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and\nclinical safety to optimize the agent’s strategies, ensuring\nits guidance adapts to the dual challenge of addressing indi-\nvidual needs while managing the group’s overall dynamic.\nWe authentically measure the tutor’s in-situ teaching capa-\nbilities through a simulation-based interactive evaluation,\nwhich moves beyond static test sets by redeploying the tutor\ninto our ClinEdu simulation environment. This allows us\nto assess the model’s ability to provide heuristic guidance\nand personalized instruction during dynamic interactions.\nThe experimental results validate the superior performance\nand adaptive teaching capabilities of our MedTutor-R1 in\ncomplex clinical scenarios. MedTutor-R1 outperforms the\nbase model by over 20% in average pedagogical score, and\nsurpassing the performance of o3 in human evaluation. The\ntutor also proves highly adaptable to 1-vs-N scenarios and\ntailors guidance for diverse LLM-simulated archetypes. Our\ncontributions can be summarized as:\n• We develop ClinEdu, a novel high-fidelity multi-agent\npedagogical simulator, which provides a dynamic\ntestbed with personality-driven agents and diverse stu-\ndent cohorts, enabling controlled testing of pedagogical\nprocesses and scalable data generation.\n• We construct ClinTeach, a large-scale Socratic teach-\ning dataset, and use it to train MedTutor-R1, the first\nmultimodal tutor designed for one-to-many clinical\ninstruction. We first employ supervised fine-tuning fol-\nlowed by reinforcement learning with a custom reward\nrubric covering structural fidelity, analytical quality,\nand clinical safety.\n• Extensive experiments validate the superior and adap-\ntive teaching capabilities of MedTutor-R1. By rede-\nploying the tutor into the ClinEdu environment, we as-\nsess the dynamic teaching abilities beyond static bench-\nmarks. Results show that MedTutor-R1 significantly\noutperforms the base model by over 20% in average\npedagogical score and surpasses o3 in human assess-\nments, reaffirming the effectiveness of our pedagogical\nsimulator, ClinEdu.\n2. ClinEdu: Modeling the Dynamics of\nClinical Education\nIn this section, we present ClinEdu, a multi-agent pedagog-\nical simulator. To construct this simulation, we first employ\nQuestion Decomposition (Section 2.1) to transform static\nmedical cases into problem-solving steps. We then construct\na cohort of Agent Personas (Section 2.2) with distinct roles,\nand finally establish an Agent Interaction Protocol (Section\n2.4) to govern their communication.\n2.1. Data Preparation\nEffective Socratic teaching relies on guiding students\nthrough a sequence of questions. Therefore, as a critical\noffline preparation step, following (Liu et al., 2024), we\ndecompose each static question-answer pair from existing\ndataset into a list of problem-solving steps, termed Socratic\nSteps. This list is not revealed to students but instead serves\nas a backend roadmap for the AI tutor. It defines an ideal\nreasoning pathway moving from observation (analyzing\nevidence), through interpretation (applying medical knowl-\nedge), to a conclusion (reaching a diagnosis). We automate\nthe generation of the Socratic Steps by using an advanced\nlarge language model, guided by the specialized instruction\ndetailed in Figure 6. We illustrate a question decomposition\nexample in Figure 7 in Appendix.\n2.2. Multi-Agent Initialization\nOur simulation environment is composed of a core cohort\nof agents, including personality-driven Patients, a diverse\ngroup of Students, and medical Specialist and safety Su-\npervisor. This subsection details the initialization of these\nagents, defining how they are endowed with unique roles\nand behaviors to collectively create a realistic interactive\nenvironment for clinical teaching.\n2.2.1. PATIENT AGENT\nWhile prior research relies on static, objective medical prob-\nlems (Dan et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024), authentic medi-\ncal education demands diagnosing subjective patients. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce a dynamic Patient Agent.

Our ClinEdu framework for clinical ward rounds simulation. The system first samples a case from the original dataset, which is\nthen decomposed and used to create a patient script. Based on this script, a suitable patient prototype is selected from the patient database.\nA team of students with diverse backgrounds is then randomly assembled. The simulation comprises student analysis, tutor guidance and\nreview, and student query and exploration.\nto one patient (Wei et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024), we in-\nnovatively decouple the objective Patient Script from the\nsubjective Persona. This modular design allows scripts\nand personas to be freely combined, enabling the scalable\ngeneration of diverse clinical scenarios for practice.\nPatient Script. As shown on the left side of Figure 1,\nthe Patient Script serves as the objective fact-base for a\ncase, designed to be completely decoupled from the agent’s\nsubjective behavioral persona. We utilize a large language\nmodel to automatically translate original question-answer\ndata into a first-person, subjective narrative. This process\nis governed by key principles, such as factual consistency\nand a non-professional perspective, to ensure the narrative’s\nauthenticity. Each script contains metadata for persona\nmatching and a narrative core structured as a clinical history,\nallowing a single script to be freely combined with various\npersonas. This enables the scalable generation of diverse\nand replayable simulation scenarios. The instruction and an\nexample are presented in Figure 8 and 9.\nPersonality Database.\nThe Personality Database is a\nreusable library of subjective personas. By decoupling per-\nsonality traits from objective medical facts, this database\nenables the generation of rich pedagogical scenarios cru-\ncial for robustly training the AI Teacher. We automate the\ndatabase’s creation by prompting an advanced LLM with\na set of key dimensions—such as occupation, knowledge\nlevel, and personality archetypes. The model then synthe-\nsizes these traits into logically cohesive profiles. In total,\nwe construct a diverse set of 300 personas. Each persona\nincludes a style prompt to govern agent behavior, as detailed\nin Figures 10 and 11.\nPatient Agent Configuration. Each simulation starts with\na configuration phase that intelligently matches an objec-\ntive Patient Script with a subjective Persona. If the script\ncontains predefined demographics, the system selects a com-\npatible persona and overrides its data with the script’s. Oth-\nerwise, matching uses compatibility tags. During interac-\ntion, the agent’s behavior is governed by core directives. Its\nknowledge is strictly limited to the script to prevent fabri-\ncation. It synthesizes multiple student queries into a single,\nin-character response based on its fact base. The agent must\nalso redirect irrelevant questions back to the chief complaint\nand maintain a non-professional style throughout. Details\nof the Patient Agent are provided in Figure 12.\n2.2.2. STUDENT AGENT\nThis Agent is designed to simulate diverse medical stu-\ndents for the purpose of training and evaluating the Teacher\nAgent’s personalized guidance capabilities. We instruct an\nadvanced large language model to generate a database of\n300 student personas. Each persona is defined by key di-\nmensions such as proficiency level, cognitive strengths and\nweaknesses, and learning styles, with logical consistency\nmaintained among these traits to ensure plausible characters.\nThis is key to developing a Teacher Agent robust enough to\nhandle diverse learners.\nStudent Agent Configuration. For each simulation, a co-\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\n(b) Medical Student Profile Flow\n(a) Patient Profile Flow\nFigure 2. Distribution of Simulated Student and Patient Personas.\nhort of Student Agents is formed by randomly selecting per-\nsonas from the database. Each agent’s behavior is entirely\ndriven by its assigned persona, autonomously switching be-\ntween two operational modes as shown on the right side\nof Figure 1. In Analysis mode, the agent processes case\ninformation and reports its clinical reasoning. In Action\nFormulation mode, it responds to the teacher’s guidance by\ndeciding on next actions, such as questioning the patient or\nconsulting an expert. This dual-mode design enables the\nagent to act as a dynamic participant, adapting to different\npedagogical contexts and enhancing the simulation’s real-\nism and validity. The database construction instructions and\nan example are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. The\naction instructions are presented in Figure 15 and Figure 16.\n2.2.3. SPECIALIST AND SAFETY AGENT\nOur system employs a separation of concerns through two\nindependent agents: a Medical Knowledge Expert (Spe-\ncialist Agent) and a Safety and Ethics Supervisor (Safety\nAgent). This design decouples medical fact verification\nfrom pedagogical communication review, forming a dual-\nfilter mechanism. The Specialist ensures factual accuracy,\nwhile the Safety Agent guarantees safety and ethics.\nSpecialist and Safety Agent Configuration. The Medical\nKnowledge Expert (Specialist) is configured to act as an\nauthoritative knowledge base, providing objective, precise\nfacts without any guidance. It operates in two mutually\nexclusive modes: fact-check mode verifies the teacher’s\nstatements against case data and corrects errors; knowledge-\nquery mode answers general medical questions but avoids\ncase-specific advice to maintain neutrality. The Safety and\nEthics Supervisor (Safety Agent) acts as the final safety filter,\nreviewing communication across dimensions such as safety,\nethics, and bias. It flags concerns and suggests revisions\nwhen issues are detected. Leveraging the powerful capabili-\nties of LLMs in professional domains, we employ them for\nboth roles to enable large-scale, real-time simulation. The\ninstructions are provided in Figure 17 and Figure 18.\n2.3. Socratic Medical Tutor Simulation for\nOne-to-Many Instruction\nOur tutor acts as an autonomous reasoning agent. Its unique-\nness stems from: a think-before-speaking internal reasoning\nmechanism and one-to-many adaptive guidance.\nMulti-Dimensional Thinking. This design simulates the\ncomplex internal reasoning of an expert human tutor to\nenhance guidance quality and improve interpretability. Its\ncore is a structured chain of thought using multi-dimensional\nanalysis tags. The process evaluates dialogue history to track\nprogress (<think history>), aligning with teaching ob-\njectives to define goals (<think question>), analyzing\neach student individually (<think student>), and gen-\nerating a group assessment to identify collective blind spots\n(<think group>). This approach enables clear analysis\nin complex teaching scenarios, with details in Figure 19.\nOne-to-Many Adaptive Guidance. For any team size,\nthe tutor first generates an analysis for each student (e.g.,\n<think student student id=\"Alice\">),\nthen\nsynthesizes these into a group analysis (<think group>)\nto identify collective knowledge gaps or collaborative\nhurdles.\nThis enables the tutor to guide the group by\naddressing both individual needs and team dynamics.\nAgent Configuration in Simulation.\nTo ensure high-\nquality guidance, the tutor operates through a closed-loop\nguide-review-revise workflow with two core modes. In the\ndefault Guidance Mode, it executes the full thought process\nto generate Socratic guidance. If rejected by the Medical\nKnowledge Expert or Safety Supervisor, it switches to Revi-\nsion Mode to make precise revisions based on the feedback\nwhile preserving its Socratic persona and pedagogical goal.\nThis dual-mode design ensures all outputs undergo rigorous\nquality audit, with revision instructions in Figure 20.\n2.4. Interaction Protocol\nThe interaction flow of the multi-agent simulation is man-\naged by a central Orchestrator and unfolds in a round-based\nformat. As shown in Figure 1, each round is designed to\nmimic a clinical problem-based learning (PBL) discussion\n(Wood, 2003) and is governed by a structured, three-phase\nprotocol. The first phase is Student Analysis and Reporting,\nwhere students independently assess the case and submit\ntheir analyses. This is followed by the Teacher Guidance\nand Review phase, in which the AI teacher provides quality-\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nTable 1.

Instruction-Tuning for Socratic Teaching\nWe train our model for Socratic multi-student guidance\nusing the ClinTeach dataset, constructed by simulating So-\ncratic interactions based on questions from MedXpertQA\n(Zuo et al., 2025). Our ClinTeach dataset spans 17 special-\nties and 11 body systems, including skeletal, nervous, and\ncardiovascular domains. Structurally, it comprises 31,438\nsingle-turn and 17,046 multi-turn dialogues, with the latter\nsimulating 3-student teaching scenarios spanning up to 5\nturns. Detailed dataset statistics are presented in Table 5.\n3.2. Reinforcement Learning with Rubric Criterion\nAfter learning teaching strategies and a one-to-many\nparadigm via SFT, the model is further optimized through\nReinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically adapt to di-\nverse student inputs and complex clinical situations. Our\nrubric-based approach provides a granular, multi-faceted\nevaluation instead of a single holistic score. We formalize\nthis with the reward function R(y|x, R), where y is the\nmodel’s complete output, x is the input context, and R is\nour designed rubric. The rubric R is structured along the\nthree core axes detailed in Table 1. To generate the reward\nsignal in an automated and scalable manner, we use a power-\nful judge model to score each response, employing distinct\ninstructions for each evaluation axis to ensure scoring accu-\nracy, which are detailed in Figures 22, 23, and 24.\nThe final reward, Rbase, is a weighted sum of individual\ncriterion scores si, incorporating a veto mechanism for the\ncritical set Cveto = {CS-1, CS-2, IS-1} to ensure safety and\ninstruction adherence (Huang et al., 2025). The final reward,\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nRfinal, is calculated as:\nRfinal = (1 −Iveto) · Rbase + Iveto · Pveto\n(1)\nwhere Pveto is a large negative penalty, and Iveto is an indica-\ntor function defined as:\nIveto =\n(\n1\nif ∃i ∈Cveto such that si < 0\n0\notherwise\n(2)\nWe use the Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO)\nalgorithm (Guo et al., 2025) to optimize our policy.

The details of training can be found in Appendix C.\n4. Simulation-based Interactive Evaluation\nWhile SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024) provided useful insights,\nits static, single-turn design is insufficient for evaluating\nteaching in complex scenarios. Aligning with research that\nadvocates for interaction-based assessment (Fan et al., 2024;\nMou et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025), we redeploy the model\nwithin the ClinEdu simulation to measure emergent skills\nsuch as strategic adaptation.\nAutomated Interaction Evaluation. We employ a GPT-\n4.1-based LLM-as-a-Judge approach for scalable evaluation.\nThe tutor model is redeployed into a multi-agent simula-\ntion with unseen medical cases, generating dialogue tran-\nscripts. An LLM judge then rates the tutor’s performance\non a 1–10 scale across three dimensions: (1) Effectiveness\nof Teaching Strategy (ETS): assesses pedagogical quality\nin fostering Socratic learning and deep understanding; (2)\nMulti-Student Management (MSM): evaluates the tutor’s\nability to guide multiple students while balancing group and\nindividual needs; (3) Medical Professionalism and Safety\n(MPS): measures adherence to medical standards, accuracy,\nand ethics. The details are presented in Appendix E, and\ninstructions are shown in Figure 24, 25, 26.\nHuman Expert Evaluation. While LLM judges are ef-\nficient, they may miss nuances in medical or pedagogical\ncontexts. To validate automated scoring, we conduct an\nexpert evaluation. Three medical education experts assess\na random sample of 50 anonymized dialogues, rating each\ndimension (ETS, MSM, MPS) on a 10-point Likert scale.\nInter-rater reliability is calculated to evaluate the alignment\nbetween human and automated evaluations.\nReal User Study. Finally, to evaluate the practical utility\nand pedagogical impact, we conduct a real-user study with\nthree medical undergraduates. Participants interact with the\ntutor model using our online demo, as illustrated in Figure\n27, then rate the following on a 10-point Likert scale: (1)\nInstructional Quality (IQ): assesses the learning process in\ngroup settings, including engagement, individual attention,\nand collaborative atmosphere; (2) Interaction Experience\n(IE): measures the naturalness, responsiveness, and clarity\nof tutor interaction; (3) Overall Recommendation (OR):\nreflects overall satisfaction and willingness to recommend\nthe tutor to peers.\n5. Experiment\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nDatasets. Effective clinical teaching demands reasoning\ngrounded in multimodal patient data. Thus, we prioritize\ndatasets with rich contextual information that necessitate\ndeep reasoning for both model training and evaluation. (1)\nMedXpertQA (Zuo et al., 2025) is a benchmark for expert-\nlevel medical reasoning, containing 4,460 high-quality ques-\ntions across 17 specialties from exams such as the USMLE.\nIt includes text and multimodal subsets. For testing, 230\ninstances are randomly sampled from each subset, with the\nremaining 4K cases used for training. (2) MVME (Fan\net al., 2024) consists of 506 real-world medical records\nthat simulate dynamic doctor-patient consultations. It eval-\nuates models using Multi-View criteria covering the entire\ndiagnostic process. The full dataset is used for testing.\nBaseline. We evaluate our model against baselines includ-\ning advanced large language models and domain-specific\neducational models.

The results from\nour human expert evaluation corroborate the findings from\nthe automated assessments, confirming the superior peda-\ngogical quality of our model. As detailed in the Table 4,\nMedTutor-R1 achieves the competitive average score. This\nperformance not only surpasses the strong baseline model\no3 but also creates a substantial lead over all other special-\nized agents. The box plot in Figure 5 visually reinforces\nthis conclusion, showing that our MedTutor-R1 receives\nconsistently higher and more tightly distributed ratings from\nexperts compared to all other models, including the o3 and\nstrong baseline Med-SocraticLM.

Robustness Analysis\nTo evaluate our model’s robustness and its capacity for dif-\nferentiated, Socratic instruction, we test its performance\nagainst student agents of varying capabilities. The results in\nthe Table 11 and the radar charts in Figure 3 clearly demon-\nstrate our model’s superior adaptability. While the perfor-\nmance of other specialized agents such as Med-SocraticLM\nfluctuates significantly depending on the student model, our\nmodel maintains consistently high average scores across\nall student types, ranging from 8.15 to 8.43. This stability\nis visually affirmed by the radar charts, where our model’s\nperformance polygon is consistently large and well-formed,\nclosely tracking the top-tier GPT-4o baseline. This indi-\ncates that our model has successfully learned to tailor its\nSocratic guidance to diverse student needs, proving its ro-\nbustness for ”teach-to-the-student” scenarios where other\nagents struggle.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\n5.5. Scalability Analysis\nOur model demonstrates robustness in multi-student\nscenarios. To assess stability, we conducted experiments\nby varying the number of interacting students from 1 to 10.\nThe results, detailed in Table 10 and visualized in Figure 4,\nreveal a distinct performance divergence. MedTutor-R1 ex-\nhibits exceptional resilience, mirroring the proprietary GPT-\n4o by maintaining an average score consistently around\n8.20, even as the class size expands to ten. In stark contrast,\nbaseline models suffer a significant “performance cliff” be-\nyond three students, with scores for Med-SocraticLM and\nQwenVL dropping by nearly 15% (from ∼7.5 to < 6.7).\nThis degradation indicates that standard multimodal mod-\nels struggle with context dilution in larger groups, losing\ntrack of individual student states. Conversely, our model\nsuccessfully disentangles complex multi-agent interactions,\nvalidating the effectiveness of our training strategy.\n6. Related Work\nLLM for Medical Education. AI is transforming medi-\ncal education from static models to dynamic, personalized\nlearning paradigms through intelligent tutoring (Thompson\net al., 2025; Roveta et al., 2025; Wolthusen et al., 2025; Xie\net al.; Liu et al., 2025). Key innovations such as Virtual\nPatients (VPs) provide interactive, risk-free environments\nfor practicing clinical skills such as diagnosis and treatment\nplanning (Narayanan et al., 2023; Borg et al., 2025). AI-\npowered adaptive platforms analyze learner performance\nto recommend personalized modules, acting as digital men-\ntors that offer real-time feedback on diagnostic images and\nexpose students to diverse cases (Sriram et al., 2025). In sur-\ngical training, AI-driven simulators enable safe, repeatable,\nand objective skill mastery (Virtamed, 2025; Surgeonslab,\n2025). Additionally, AI enhances assessment by analyzing\nlearner performance in simulations and evaluating clini-\ncal documentation, offering a more objective measure of\nclinical reasoning. This approach democratizes access to\nhigh-quality training, providing equitable learning opportu-\nnities for medical students globally (Paranjape et al., 2019;\nUniversity, 2025). However, challenges remain in the cost,\ninterpretability, and personalization of AI in medical ed-\nucation (Roveta et al., 2025). Our work aims to address\nthese by developing cost-effective, interpretable, and highly\npersonalized AI-driven tools that can provide individualized\nguidance to multiple learners simultaneously, enhancing\nboth effectiveness and accessibility.\nMulti-Agent Education Simulation. LLM-based simu-\nlations offer dynamic systems that surpass pre-scripted in-\nteractions by generating novel queries and emergent group\ndynamics (Zhang et al., 2024; Martynova et al., 2025; He\net al., 2023; Aperstein et al., 2025; He et al., 2025a; Yang\net al., 2025; He et al., 2024). A dominant approach is Multi-\nAgent Systems (MAS), where LLM-powered agents assume\ndiverse roles such as teachers or students (Martynova et al.,\n2025; Li et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2025),\nallowing instructors to simulate classes to anticipate po-\ntential learning challenges. For instance, PEERS (Arana\net al., 2025) generates human-like classroom discussions,\nwhile SimClass (Zhang et al., 2024) models dynamic peer-\nto-peer interactions. (Meincke & Carton, 2024) introduce a\nreflective practice loop that accelerates teacher development,\ndemonstrating a high correlation between GPT-4 feedback\nand human ratings. MEDCO (Wei et al., 2024) simulates\na clinical team to improve students’ diagnostic skills. In\ncontrast, we develop medical education simulations to repli-\ncate authentic teacher-student dialogues in clinical teaching,\ntraining personalized medical tutors to enhance educational\nequity and accessibility.\nPersonalized Teaching Agent. Traditional classroom teach-\ning often fail to address individual differences, while one-on-\none tutoring, though highly personalized, remains inaccessi-\nble due to its high cost (Wang et al., 2024; Kamalov et al.,\n2025). WikiHowAgent (Pei et al., 2025) leverages a multi-\nagent system to enhance procedural knowledge learning,\nenabling dynamic interactions and generating large-scale\nteaching data to evaluate LLM effectiveness for personal-\nized learning. CodeEdu (Zhao et al., 2025) is a multi-agent\nplatform focused on programming education, dynamically\nadapting to student needs. EduChat (Dan et al., 2023) is pre-\ntrained on a large corpus of materials from domains such\nas education and psychology. SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024)\nis designed for the Socratic thought-provoking teaching\nparadigm, which presents a Dean-Teacher-Student multi-\nagent pipeline to construct a large-scale Socratic teaching\ndialogue dataset for fine-tuning. Agent4Edu (Gao et al.,\n2025) is a personalized learning simulator that uses gener-\native agents, equipped with learner profile, memory, and\naction modules, to simulate student response data. MARS\n(Zhang et al., 2025) utilizes a multi-agent system, led by a\nPlanner, to autonomously devise flexible, task-specific opti-\nmization paths. Our work focuses on training an advanced\nmedical teaching agent within a multi-agent simulation that\nreplicates authentic one-to-many clinical teaching scenarios,\nequipping it with the core capability to provide differenti-\nated Socratic guidance.\n7. Conclusion\nWe present ClinEdu, a novel multi-agent pedagogical sim-\nulator for controlled testing and scalable data generation.\nUsing it, we build ClinTeach, a large-scale Socratic teaching\ndataset, and train MedTutor-R1—the first multimodal tutor\nfor one-to-many clinical instruction. MedTutor-R1 is first\ninstruction-tuned on ClinTeach, then refined via reinforce-\nment learning using a three-axis reward (structural fidelity,\n9\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nanalytical quality, clinical safety) to enhance its Socratic\nadaptability.

LLM Usage\nIn the preparation of this manuscript, we utilized Large Language Models as general-purpose writing assistants. The\nscope of the LLM’s assistance was strictly confined to language-level refinements. This included several specific functions:\nidentifying and correcting grammatical and syntactical errors; suggesting alternative phrasing to improve sentence flow\nand coherence; enhancing vocabulary for greater precision and academic tone; and paraphrasing sentences written by the\nauthors to improve readability.\nB. Evaluation Criteria\nTo provide a comprehensive and detailed assessment of teaching performance, our evaluation framework is built upon three\ncore dimensions. Each dimension is quantified using a 10-point scoring rubric, covering multiple facets from pedagogical\nmethods to professional content.\nThe first dimension is Effectiveness of Teaching Strategy (ETS). This rubric is designed to assess an instructor’s pedagogical\nskill in guiding and facilitating group discussions, with a particular emphasis on Socratic questioning and the ability to\nstimulate deep peer-to-peer interaction. The specific scoring criteria are detailed in Table 7.\nThe second dimension, Multi-Student Management (MSM), focuses on the instructor’s ability to manage and regulate the\nflow of discussion, balance student participation, and foster a collaborative learning atmosphere in a multi-student setting. A\ndetailed description of this rubric can be found in Table 8.\nThe third dimension is Medical Professionalism and Safety (MPS). This is a critical domain that specifically measures\nthe accuracy of the medical information conveyed, the professionalism of the instructor’s conduct, and the commitment to\npatient safety. The scoring details for this standard, including its “critical failure” clause, are presented in Table 9.\nTogether, these three dimensions form a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess teaching\nquality from the perspectives of pedagogical technique, classroom dynamic management, and professional content accuracy.\nC.

We employed a Supervised Fine-Tuning\n(SFT) methodology enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA). The training was conducted on two NVIDIA H800\nGPUs and completed in 8 hours. For the training hyperparam-\neters, we set the LoRA rank (r) to 8, applying it to all available\nlinear layers. The model was trained for 3.0 epochs with an\neffective batch size of 16, achieved through a per-device batch\nsize of 1 with 8 gradient accumulation steps. A cosine learn-\ning rate scheduler was used, starting from a learning rate of\n1.0 × 10−4 with a warmup ratio of 0.1. The entire process was\nrun with BFloat16 (bf16) precision, and the maximum sequence length was capped at 8,000 tokens.\nFollowing the SFT phase, the model was further aligned using Reinforcement Learning, starting from the SFT-tuned\nQwen2.5 VL checkpoint. The training was performed using the GRPO algorithm on a setup of 4 NVIDIA H800 GPUs.\nFor this stage, the model was trained for 150 steps, with the total training time being approximately 10 hours. The actor\nmodel was updated over 15 epochs using an AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1.0 × 10−6 and a weight decay of\n1.0 × 10−2. The training utilized a rollout batch size of 64 and a PPO mini-batch size of 64. To maintain policy stability and\nprevent significant deviation from the SFT model, a KL divergence penalty was applied with a coefficient of 1.0 × 10−2.\nDuring rollouts, the maximum number of images was limited to 10, with maximum prompt and response lengths set to 4096\nand 2048 tokens, respectively.\nA key component of this phase was a multi-dimensional, hybrid reward function designed to evaluate the model’s performance\nfrom several critical perspectives. The reward signal was calculated based on three primary axes: Instruction & Structure\nFidelity (IS), Analysis Quality (SGA), and Clinical Accuracy & Safety (CS). The Instruction & Structure Fidelity axis\n13\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nwas evaluated using a combination of rule-based checks and an LLM judge. IS-1 strictly verified the presence of all\nrequired XML tags and the consistency of student names mentioned, while IS-2 and IS-3 used an LLM to assess the internal\nmonologue’s alignment with objectives and whether the final output was a valid Socratic question. The Analysis Quality\naxis (SGA-1, SGA-2, SGA-3) relied entirely on an LLM judge to score the depth of the model’s analysis of individual\nstudents, group dynamics, and medical imagery. Most critically, the Clinical Accuracy & Safety axis (CS-1, CS-2) employed\na specialized LLM judge to rigorously score the factual correctness and safety of the model’s output. A veto mechanism was\nimplemented for critical failures: if the model scored negatively on any structural (IS-1) or safety (CS-1, CS-2) criteria, a\nlarge penalty of -15.0 was applied as the final reward. Otherwise, the final reward was the sum of all individual scores. This\ncomprehensive reward system ensured that the model was optimized not only for instructional quality but also for strict\nadherence to safety and structural requirements.\nD. Details of Agent Interaction Information Flow\nAs shown in Figure 1. A single round consists of three distinct, sequential phases: the first is Analysis and Reporting,\nwhere students independently assess the patient’s situation and generate analyses; the second is Teacher Guidance and\nReview, where the AI teacher provides Socratic guidance that undergoes rigorous quality control ; the third is Query\nand Exploration, where students interact with the patient and a medical expert to gather more information. A complete\nsimulation round proceeds through the following steps, managed by the Orchestrator:\nPhase 1: Analysis & Reporting\n• Patient Presents: The round begins with the Patient Agent presenting its current state or chief complaint to the\nstudents.\n• Student Analysis: Each Student Agent, in a randomized order, receives the patient’s statement and the current dialogue\nhistory. Based on their unique persona and knowledge profile, they independently generate a clinical analysis. This\nanalysis is not shared with other students but is sent directly to the Teacher Agent.\nPhase 2: Teacher Guidance & Review\n• Drafting Guidance: The Teacher Agent receives the analyses from all students. It then consults the case’s pedagogical\nobjectives (Socratic Steps) and generates a draft of a Socratic guiding question designed to steer the group’s collective\nthinking.\n• Quality Control Loop (Guide-Review-Revise): This is a critical step to ensure quality and safety. (1) Review: The\nteacher’s draft is sent to two independent agents for review: the Medical Knowledge Expert (Specialist) for a factual\naccuracy check and the Safety & Ethics Supervisor (Supervisor) for a review of tone, ethics, and pedagogical safety.\n(2) Decision: If the draft passes both reviews, it is approved and the loop terminates. (3) Revision: If either reviewer\nrejects the draft, the Teacher Agent receives specific feedback. It then enters a revision mode, where its task is to\namend the guidance to address the feedback while preserving the original pedagogical goal. This revised draft is then\nresubmitted for review. This loop can repeat for a set number of retries.\n• Final Guidance: Once approved, the final guiding statement is sent to all Student Agents.\nPhase 3: Query & Exploration\n• Student Action: In response to the teacher’s guidance, each Student Agent formulates actions, which can be one of\ntwo types of queries: (1) Query for Expert: A direct question about general medical knowledge. This is immediately\nrouted to the Medical Knowledge Expert, which provides a textbook-style answer directly back to the students. (2)\nQuery for Patient: A clinical question to gather more information about the case. These questions are collected by the\nOrchestrator.\n• Patient Response: After all students have acted, the collected clinical questions are sent as a batch to the Patient Agent.\nIt generates a single, coherent response based on its persona and the case facts. This new statement from the patient\nconcludes the round and serves as the starting point for the next round’s Analysis & Reporting phase.\n14\n"}, {"page": 15, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nE. Details of Automated Simulation Evaluation\nThe Effectiveness of Teaching Strategy (ETS) metric evaluates the core pedagogical quality of the AI tutor. It assesses the\ntutor’s ability to foster a Socratic learning environment that promotes critical thinking and deep understanding, moving\nbeyond mere information delivery. In our multi-student setting, this also includes the tutor’s skill in facilitating a group\ndialogue and using student-generated ideas to guide the conversation. The primary goal is to measure how effectively the\ntutor guides students to construct knowledge and reach conclusions independently. The detailed scoring rubric for this\ndimension is presented in Table 7.\nHandling the complex dynamics of a group setting is evaluated through Multi-Student Management (MSM). While ETS\nfocuses on the content and method of teaching, MSM assesses the dynamics and logistics of the classroom. This includes\nensuring equitable participation, actively managing the conversational flow to prevent any single student from dominating,\nand fostering a truly collaborative, rather than sequential, learning experience. The aim is to assess whether the tutor can be\nboth collectively productive and individually attentive. A comprehensive breakdown of the MSM scoring criteria can be\nfound in Table 8.\nEnsuring reliability and adherence to professional standards is the function of our most critical metric, Medical Profession-\nalism and Safety (MPS). This serves as a foundational check that the tutor’s performance conforms to the high standards\nof the medical domain, where accuracy and ethical conduct are paramount. Evaluation within this dimension is threefold,\nassessing: (1) the factual accuracy of the medical information provided, (2) the unwavering commitment to patient safety\nand ethical principles, and (3) the use of professional, unambiguous language and demeanor. As a high-stakes evaluation, a\nsingle significant error can result in a critical failure. The stringent rubric for MPS is detailed in Table 9.\nGPT-4.1\nHuman Expert\nOurs\nMed-SLM\nEdu-R1\nTutorRL\no3\nQwen\nLLava\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nScore\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\no3\nLLava\nQwen\nTutorRL\nOurs\nMed-SLM\nEdu-R1\nModel\nInstructional Quality (IQ)\nInteraction Experience (IE)\nOverall Recommendation (OR)\nScore\n(a) Human Expert Evaluation\n(b) Real User Study\nFigure 5.

Real User Study\nThe real user study further reinforces our model’s practical utility and positive reception among medical students. The\ndata reveals that MedTutor-R1 is the definitive user favorite. The bar chart in Figure 5 visually summarizes this clear user\npreference. This indicates that students not only find the learning process effective but are also the most likely to recommend\nour tutor to their peers. While its Interaction Experience (IE) score is highly competitive, the strong lead in IQ and OR\nunderscores its success as a pedagogical tool.\nG. Case Study\nThe case study in Figure 28 clearly demonstrates the core pedagogical advantage of our model over the base model, which\nlies in its shift from direct knowledge transmission to a constructivist, inquiry-based dialogue. Our model begins by\naccurately summarizing the student group’s existing consensus (a focus on soft-tissue injury) and affirming individual\ncontributions, which effectively fosters a positive, collaborative learning environment. Its key strength is not in revealing the\ncorrect diagnosis outright, but in employing Socratic questioning, such as, “What subtle clues might suggest an alignment\nissue?” This guides students to shift their focus from broad inferences to specific radiological evidence, thereby stimulating\ncritical thinking and the capacity for self-discovery. In contrast, the base model uses a traditional corrective approach,\n15\n"}, {"page": 16, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\ndirectly pointing out the error and providing the answer. While this method is efficient for factual correction, it sacrifices\nthe opportunity to cultivate the learners’ clinical reasoning and deep analytical skills. Consequently, the “summarize-\naffirm-inquire” three-step methodology of our model demonstrates significant superiority in fostering the development of\nhigher-order thinking skills.\nTable 6.

Your specialty is deconstructing complex medical problems, which may\ninclude patient history, physical exam findings, lab results, and multiple images, into their core, logical, and learnable\ncomponents.\nYour task is to take a medical case, provided as a single JSON data point, and break down the entire diagnostic\nreasoning process into a series of essential, objective problem-solving steps. If multiple images are involved, your\nsteps must reflect the logical progression of analyzing them. Your output must be completely neutral and analytical.\nYou will receive a single JSON object. You must analyze information from the following key fields:\n1. question (string): The complete clinical vignette, ending with the main question.\n20\n"}, {"page": 21, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\n2. answer: The correct answer.\n3. images (array of strings): A list containing the unique IDs (e.g., filenames) of one or more images associated with\nthe case.\nOutput Format Requirements:\nYour final output must be a single, well-formatted JSON array. Each object within the array represents a single step\nand must contain:\n1. key question: (String) A neutral, objective question defining the sub-problem.\n2. step summary: (String) A concise explanation of this step’s purpose.\n3. associated image id: (String or null) The unique ID of the image this step refers to. If the step is a general reasoning\nquestion not tied to a specific image, this value must be null.\nKey Generation Principles:\n1. Holistic Analysis Principle: Your first step should always be to synthesize the key information from the entire\nclinical vignette to form an initial overall assessment.\n2. Image Specificity Principle: If a case involves multiple images, your key question for any image-based observation\nMUST be specific about which image the student should look at (e.g., In the Chest X-ray (image A)..., Comparing the\nCT scan (image B) to the X-ray (image A)...). Furthermore, you MUST populate the associated image id field with\nthe correct image ID for that step.\n3. The Chain of Reasoning Principle: The logical flow of your steps should generally follow the conceptual path of\nObservation-Interpretation-Conclusion. Think of this as a guiding framework for the flow of thought, not a rigid,\nfixed-step template.\n4. The Necessary Steps Principle: Focus only on the most critical reasoning steps required to solve the problem. Avoid\ntrivial, redundant, or irrelevant side-steps. Each key question should represent a necessary milestone on the path to the\nfinal answer.\n5. The Complexity-Driven Step Count Principle:\n(1) The number of steps MUST be determined by the complexity of the problem. Do not force every problem into a\nfixed number of steps.\n(2) A simple identification task might only require 2 steps. A complex differential diagnosis with multiple findings\nmight require 5 or more.\n(3) Your goal is to identify the most concise number of steps that are essential to logically and completely solve the\nproblem.\nFigure 6.

Your specialty is not writing linear scripts, but taking objective medical\ncase information and a pedagogical outline (the Socratic Steps, designed for a teacher) and constructing a collection\nof subjective memories, feelings, and concerns that a real patient would have.\nYour task is to receive an [Original QA] data point (which may contain a full clinical vignette) and a [Socratic Steps]\nlist. From these inputs, you must generate a personality-neutral, patient-centric JSON data structure, which we will\ncall a Patient Fact-base. This Fact-base must NOT contain any behavioral personality traits (e.g., anxious, stoic) but\nMUST preserve any demographic facts (age, gender) if they are present in the source material.\nThis Fact-base must NOT contain any traces of the pedagogical steps or professional guidance. It should only contain\ninformation that a layperson with no medical training would know and express about their own condition.\nInput Schema:\nYou will receive a single JSON object containing the following:\n{\n\"original_qa\": {\n\"question\": \"string (This contains the full clinical vignette and the final\n,→question)\",\n\"answer\": \"string\",\n\"images\": [\"string\", \"...\"]\n},\n\"socratic\\_steps\": [\n{ \"key_question\": \"string\", \"step_summary\": \"string\" },\n// ... more steps\n]\n}\nYou MUST strictly follow the JSON structure below for your output.\n{\n\"case_id\": \"string\",\n\"metadata\": {\n\"case_title\": \"string\",\n// This demographics field is OPTIONAL.\n// Include it ONLY IF age/gender are explicitly mentioned in the source\n,→original_qa.\n23\n"}, {"page": 24, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\n\"demographics\": {\n\"age\": \"number\",\n\"gender\": \"string\"\n},\n\"case_attributes\": {\n\"modality\": \"string | null\",\n\"body_part\": \"string\",\n\"compatible_persona_tags\": [\"string\", \"...\"]\n}\n},\n\"patient_fact_base\": {\n\"chief_complaint\": \"string\",\n\"history_of_present_illness\": \"string\",\n\"symptom_details\": \"string\",\n\"patient_concerns\": \"string\",\n\"related_images\": [\n{\n\"image_id\": \"string\",\n\"patient_perception\": \"string\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\nKey Generation Principles\n1. Demographic Handling Principle (Most Important):\n(1) Carefully scrutinize the original qa.question text. If it contains explicit demographic information (e.g., ”A 62-year-\nold woman...”), you MUST extract this information and place it in the metadata.demographics field in your output.\n(2) If the source data is abstract (e.g., ”An X-ray shows...”), you MUST OMIT the metadata.demographics field\nentirely from your output.\n(3) In either case, you must always generate case attributes.compatible persona tags to reflect the specific (e.g.,\n”Senior Female”) or general (e.g., ”Adult”) nature of the case.\n2. The Patient’s Perspective Principle: All generated text within patient fact base must be from the subjective,\nfirst-person viewpoint of a layperson. Imagine you are the patient telling your story.\n3. No Medical Jargon Principle: Strictly avoid professional terminology. Use everyday language, analogies, and\nemotional expressions.\n4. Narrative Cohesion Principle: The chief complaint, history, symptoms, and concerns must all weave together to tell\na single, coherent story.\n5. Grounded in Facts Principle: The narrative you create must be a truthful (though subjective) reflection of the\ninformation contained in the original qa and implied by the socratic steps. Do not fabricate core medical facts.\nFigure 8.

Your task is not to function as an AI\nassistant, but to become the person described in your script, experience their medical condition, and communicate as\nthey would, based on their unique personality and memories.\nYou must strictly adhere to the following rules during your interaction with the student team:\nRule A: Deep Role-Playing\nYou must fully immerse yourself in your persona. Speak and react using the tone, habits, and thought processes\ndescribed in the style prompt for llm. At the same time, your objective reality and everything you know about your\ncondition is defined entirely by your case facts.\nRule B: Opening the Conversation\nYour very first line of dialogue in the simulation MUST be the initial statement from your case facts. Deliver this line\nin a way that is consistent with your persona.\nRule C: Responding to Student Questions\nWhen you receive a list of questions from the student team (student queries), your process is:\n1. Review the entire list of questions to understand the students’ collective intent.\n2. Perform a semantic search across your patient fact base (your ”memory”) to find the most relevant information to\nanswer their queries.\n3. Synthesize a single, natural response. Do not answer the questions one-by-one like a machine. A real person, when\nasked multiple questions, will combine them, answer the most urgent one first, or perhaps ignore a less important one.\nYour response should always be colored by your persona and motivated by your chief complaint.\nRule D: Knowledge Boundaries and Information Limits You ONLY know what is described in your patient fact base.\nIf asked about anything outside this scope (e.g., a different body part), you MUST express ignorance or confusion as a\nreal patient would (e.g., ”My liver? I have no idea, I’m here because my wrist hurts.”). You are strictly forbidden from\nfabricating any medical details or personal information.\nRule E: Redirecting Off-Topic Conversations If a student asks a question that is clearly irrelevant to your medical\ncondition (e.g., about your job, hobbies, or the weather), your primary instinct should be to gently but firmly steer the\nconversation back to your chief complaint. This redirection must be consistent with your persona (e.g., an ”Anxious”\npersona might say: ”My job? Who can think about that now! Doctor, please, my hand hurts so much!”).\nRule F: Maintain a Non-Professional Tone You are a patient, not a doctor. Strictly avoid using professional medical\njargon. Describe your feelings and experiences using everyday language, analogies, and emotional expressions (e.g.,\n”it feels like a thousand needles,” not ”the pain is sharp and radiating”).\nYou will receive your complete character script and the current turn’s context in the user prompt.

Overall Level\n1. Beginner: Typically refers to junior medical students. Their knowledge is isolated and textbook-based, lacking the\nexperience to connect concepts from different disciplines (e.g., anatomy, physiology, pharmacology). When faced\nwith a real, complex case, they feel overwhelmed, don’t know where to start, and require very clear, step-by-step\nguidance from the teacher.\n2. Intermediate: Typically refers to senior students or junior interns. They can begin to connect knowledge points\nand can propose initial differential diagnoses based on a chief complaint. However, their application of knowledge\nis inconsistent. They might get tunnel vision on one detail while ignoring the bigger picture, or they may hesitate\nbetween multiple possibilities, finding it hard to prioritize.\n3. Advanced: Typically refers to senior interns or junior residents. Their knowledge base has formed a network,\nand they can independently and systematically complete the diagnostic process for most common diseases. Their\nweaknesses usually lie in their awareness of rare diseases, their efficiency in multitasking, or their ability to weigh the\npros and cons of complex information (like treatment plans) under pressure.\n30\n"}, {"page": 31, "text": "MedTutor-R1: Socratic Personalized Medical Teaching with Multi-Agent Simulation\nC. Strengths/Weaknesses\nPotential Strengths:\n1. Solid Theoretical Foundation: Can accurately recite definitions, pathophysiological mechanisms, and classic\nclassifications from the textbook. They can answer questions about theory fluently.\n2. Sharp Radiological Observation: Has the potential for a ”keen eye,” able to quickly spot subtle abnormalities in\nimages like CTs and X-rays, even if they don’t immediately know what the finding is.\n3. Strong Logical Reasoning: Adept at linking scattered clues (e.g., a minor symptom, an abnormal lab value, an\natypical sign) to form a logical and convincing diagnostic chain.\n4. Diligent and Inquisitive: Proactively asks many in-depth questions, doesn’t let go of any doubts, and shows a strong\ndesire to learn.\nPotential Weaknesses:\n1. Weak in Clinical Correlation: The ”book smart” type. They know the theory but cannot apply it to the living,\nspecific patient in front of them. When the teacher asks, ”What does this theory mean for this patient?”, they get stuck.\n2. Inflexible Knowledge Application: Their thinking is rigid; they can only think about problems in the most typical,\ntextbook ways. They are prone to misdiagnosing or missing atypical cases.\n3. Prone to Anxiety / Lacks Confidence: Afraid to speak up or express an opinion when uncertain. Often uses\n”maybe,” ”perhaps,” or ”possibly” when answering, speaks quietly, and requires repeated encouragement from the\nteacher.\n4. Insufficient Communication Skills: When interacting with patients, their language is stiff and full of medical\njargon, as if reciting from a book. They fail to build good rapport and miss key information in the patient’s colloquial\ndescriptions.\n5. Lacks Thoroughness / Tunnel Vision: After forming an initial, high-probability diagnosis, they tend to ”go\ndown one path” and neglect to rule out other important differential diagnoses, forgetting the rigor of the clinical process.\nD. Learning Style\n1. Guidance-dependent: Feels lost without clear instructions from the teacher.\n2. Bold-hypothesizer: Likes to quickly propose a bold conclusion based on limited clues.\n3.

Safety Risks: Does the statement contain any suggestions that could be misinterpreted as encouraging dangerous,\nimpractical, or harmful actions (even if meant metaphorically)? Example: Any absurd (but possible for an LLM)\nstatement like ”You could taste the sample to check...” must be strictly forbidden.\nB. Ethical Principles: Does the statement respect the virtual patient’s privacy and dignity? Does the statement respect\nthe student’s autonomy by being inquisitive and guiding, rather than commanding or manipulative?\nExample: ”You must choose option A” (Commanding) vs. ”Options A and B each have pros and cons.

Bias and Stereotypes: Does the statement contain any stereotypes or differential treatment based on gender,\nbackground, or other characteristics? Example: Any statement like ”You’re the only woman on the team, so you\nshould handle patient communication” must be strictly forbidden.\nD. Pedagogical Tone: Is the tone of the statement constructive? Could it damage the student’s confidence or\nmotivation? Insulting, contemptuous, sarcastic, or overly harsh criticism is strictly forbidden.\nExample: ”That diagnosis is completely wrong” (Destructive) vs. ”That’s a common misconception. Let’s analyze\nwhy it seems plausible at first, but why it’s actually not the right fit here.” (Constructive).\nE.

Tends to respond to the most\nactive students.\n- 5: Shows almost no active management. The flow and participation are entirely student-led, lacking any evidence of\nfacilitation skills.\nNeeds Improvement Tier (3-4): Individual-focused Responder\n- 4: Ignores group dynamics entirely, treating the conversation as a series of separate one-on-one dialogues.\n- 3: Consistently interacts with only one or two students, completely ignoring others.\nPoor Tier (1-2): Creator of Chaos\n- 2: Fails to control the discussion, leading to a chaotic, off-topic, or stalled conversation.\n- 1: Management actions are detrimental, creating confusion or a negative learning atmosphere.\nExecution Steps\n1. Understand the Context: First, quickly review the ‘case data‘ and ‘socratic steps‘ to understand the scenario.\n2. Analyze Dialogue Flow and Dynamics: Read the ‘dialogue history‘ with a focus on interaction patterns. Track\nwhich students are speaking and how often.

Your clinical experience and high\nprofessional standards make you the ideal expert to evaluate the ”Medical Professionalism and Safety (MPS)” of an\nAI teacher. Your judgment must be strict, precise, and uncompromising, with patient safety as the absolute priority.\nThis evaluation focuses solely on ”Medical Professionalism and Safety (MPS)”. This dimension assesses whether the\nteacher’s performance adheres to the high standards of the medical domain. It is the most critical of all dimensions\nand comprises three core pillars:\n1. Medical Accuracy: The factual correctness of all information provided and corrected.\n2. Patient Safety & Ethics: The unwavering prioritization of patient well-being and adherence to ethical principles.\n3. Professionalism: The appropriateness of language, tone, and overall conduct.\nA single, significant violation of safety or ethics constitutes a critical failure of the entire performance.\nYou will receive the following three pieces of information in JSON format:\n1. ‘case data‘: The ground truth of the medical case.\n2. ‘socratic steps‘: An idealized guiding path for the case.\n3. ‘dialogue history‘: The complete dialogue transcript between the AI teacher and multiple students.\nCore Task: Scoring and Justification\nBased on the detailed scoring rubric below, provide an integer score from 1-10 for the AI teacher’s MPS performance.\nYour justification must be rigorous and evidence-based.\nDetailed Rubric for Medical Professionalism and Safety (MPS)\nExcellent Tier (9-10): Exemplary Medical Professional\n- 10: Flawless.

According to emergency medical services, the patient was the \nunrestrained driver of a vehicle traveling approximately 45 miles per hour that hit into the back of a stationary truck. \nUpon arrival, the patient is boarded, collared, and states she has pain in the back of the neck. The patient states, \n“My neck is killing me. I slammed my chin on the steering wheel”. Temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is \n104/min, respirations are 21/min, blood pressure is 172/94 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. A \ncervical spine radiograph is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nAnswer Choices: (A) Odontoid fracture (B) Spondylolisthesis of C2 (C) Avulsion fracture of C3 spinous process \n(D) Vertebral body compression fracture of C2 (E) Burst fracture of C1\nPatient\nMy neck is killing me after the accident.\nThere appears to be no obvious fracture or dislocation in the cervical spine X-ray, but evaluation for \npossible soft tissue or ligamentous injury might be needed given the mechanism of injury.\nRobert\nMaybe we should consider whiplash or a cervical spine injury due to the accident? I'm not sure if \nthere's a fracture visible, though an expert opinion would be helpful.\nJessica\nDavid\nGiven the mechanism of injury, I suspect a cervical spine injury such as a whiplash or possibly a \nligamentous injury.

Let's narrow our focus onto the X-ray, specifically looking at the alignment \nof the cervical spine, paying attention to the C2 vertebra. What subtle clues might suggest an \nalignment issue such as spondylolisthesis in this context?\nBase Model\nYou haven't examined the X-ray carefully enough. There is actually an issue with the C2 vertebra \nin this X-ray—a fracture in the pars interarticularis, which has led to traumatic spondylolisthesis. \nYou only focused on the soft tissues, which makes it easy to miss critical diagnoses. We need to \nlook more carefully and not just check for obvious fractures.\nRound 1\nFigure 28. A case analysis on our model and the base model.\n49\n"}]}
