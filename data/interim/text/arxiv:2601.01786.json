Those models are often trained on sensitive user data,\nincluding personally identifiable information (hereinafter referred\nto as PII), which can be unintentionally memorized and revealed\nduring inference.\nWhile direct and high-profile data breach, such as Marriott [24]\n(disclosing contact and payment information of 5.2 million individ-\nuals) and Equifax [10] (compromising records of over 140 million\nU.S. consumers) cases, draw significant attention, the indirect ex-\nposures [29] from trained models also raise privacy concerns. In\nresponse, regulations such as the General Data Protection Regula-\ntion (GDPR) [35], the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [4],\nand China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) [42] man-\ndate the complete elimination (e.g., right to erasure or right to be\nforgotten) of PII upon user request or following a security breach.\nTo address such concerns, machine unlearning has emerged as a\npromising direction for selectively removing specific training data\npoints without full model retraining. In practice, however, efficient\npost-hoc data deletion in large-scale models presents several chal-\nlenges. First, removing individual records from models with billions\nof parameters is computationally demanding in the absence of orig-\ninal training corpus [2]. Second, unlearning strategies often impair\nglobal model utility, as the removal process inadvertently updates\nknowledge beyond the intended deletion scope [23]. Third, unlearn-\ning must ideally support incremental and online operation to handle\ndeletion requests as they arise, without disrupting service avail-\nability [16] while preserving acceptable resource efficiency [30].\nLastly, given the evolving landscape of global privacy regulations,\nthe adaptability of unlearning techniques to shifting legal require-\nments constitutes a key operational advantage. Collectively, these\ntechnical, operational, and regulatory hurdles highlight the need\nfor specialized methodologies that enable efficient, reliable, and\nlegally compliant data removal in production-scale models.\nEarly methods, such as SISA [2], improve efficiency by parti-\ntioning the dataset into isolated shards and retraining only those\naffected by deletion requests. However, such means face scalability\nchallenges when applied to large-scale models (e.g., LLMs) due to\ntheir high computational cost. Gradient-based approaches [3, 23, 39]\narXiv:2601.01786v1  [cs.LG]  5 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "ICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nIntae Jeon, Yujeong Kwon, and Hyungjoon Koo\nupdate model parameters to reverse the influence of unlearning sam-\nples. Meanwhile, preference optimization approaches [23, 27, 34, 47]\nmodify model outputs by penalizing undesirable responses and pro-\nmoting preferred alternatives. Recent advancements in parameter-\nefficient techniques [6, 11] reduce computational overhead by lim-\niting updates to a small subset of parameters; however, they often\nassume the availability of reference models or a retention dataset\nto maintain original performance. Another direction is entity-level\nunlearning, such as Opt-Out [7], which enables the removal of\nentire entity embeddings (e.g., users, items, records).\nWhile the previous approaches are effective in certain unlearning\ncontexts, their effectiveness may diminish when applied to PII-level\nforgetting on real-world datasets. The limitation arises from two\nkey challenges: 1 applying the same forgetting strategy to every\nPII attribute (e.g., name, social security number) in the unlearning\ndataset may not be effective without accounting for differences\nin privacy sensitivity (or risk), and 2 prior works often rely on a\nretention set, which may be unavailable in (PII-relevant) practical\nscenarios.\nIn this work, we propose UnPII, the first PII-centric unlearning\napproach that dynamically prioritizes PII forgetting based on the\nprivacy risk of individual or combined PII attributes. By design,\nUnPII can be seamlessly incorporated with any gradient-based un-\nlearning methods, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) [23], Negative\nPreference Optimization (NPO) [47], and Direct Preference Opti-\nmization (DPO) [34]. In essence, given a PII-containing model, UnPII\nbegins with identifying PII in the model’s output through consulta-\ntions with a large language model using PII-inducing queries. Next,\nUnPII computes a PII risk index (PRI; ranging from 0 to 1), quanti-\nfying the exposure risk of PII, either individually or in combination.\nLastly, UnPII unlearns the target dataset by applying a gradient-\nscaling loss function, adjusting the forgetting signal based on the\ncomputed risk value. To facilitate this, we construct a synthetic PII\ndataset (e.g., 1,700 PII examples), generating a PII-containing model.\nBesides, we introduce a quantifiable PII risk assessment metric that\nevaluates the privacy risk associated with the PII attribute exposure,\nwhich captures varying factors such as identifiability, sensitivity,\nusability, linkability, permanency, exposability, and compliancy.\nFrom an industrial MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) per-\nspective, UnPII can be seamlessly integrated into Continuous Train-\ning (CT) pipelines. Unlike full retraining that incurs prohibitive\nGPU costs and poses risks to service availability, UnPII operates as\na parameter-efficient fine-tuning module. This design allows prac-\ntitioners to batch PII deletion requests and apply updates within\nstandard CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)\ncycles, thereby reconciling strict privacy compliance requirements\nwith operational efficiency.\nOur empirical evaluation, conducted with three baseline ap-\nproaches (e.g., GA, NPO, DPO) across various forgetting ratios (e.g.,\n1%, 5%, 10%), demonstrates that UnPII outperforms these baselines,\nimproving the harmonic mean (up to 5%) of accuracy (up to 11.8%),\nutility (up to 6.3%), and generalizability (up to 12.4%), with a modest\nfine-tuning overhead (27.5% on average).\nThe main contributions of our paper are as follows:\n• We introduce UnPII, the first PII-centric machine unlearning ap-\nproach that dynamically prioritizes the PII forgetting based on\nthe risk of individual or combined PII attributes.\n• We propose a quantifiable PII risk assessment metric that evalu-\nates the privacy risk associated with PII attribute exposure.\n• We construct a synthetic PII dataset (e.g., 1,700 PII instances) that\nsimulates realistic exposure scenarios, providing a benchmark\nfor evaluating the effectiveness of PII unlearning techniques.\n• We integrate UnPII with three (popular) unlearning techniques\n(i.e., GA, NPO, and DPO) and evaluate them in terms of accuracy,\nutility, and generalizability.\nWe released our source code and dataset to foster further research\nin the field of machine unlearning for privacy protection 1.\n2\nBackground\nMachine Unlearning and Challenges. Contemporary regula-\ntions such as GDPR (EU) [35] and CCPA (California) [4] enforce the\nright to be forgotten, granting individuals the authority to request\nthe deletion of their (potentially sensitive) personal data. In re-\nsponse, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising approach\nto forget a subset of data samples from a trained model. Namely,\ngiven an initial model 𝑓(𝜃𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡) on the full dataset 𝐷, it aims to de-\nrive an unlearned model 𝑓(𝜃𝑢) that forgets the unlearning dataset\n(𝐷𝑓⊂𝐷), while preserving the behavior of a reference model 𝑓(𝜃𝑟)\nretrained from scratch on the retention dataset (𝐷𝑟= 𝐷\\ 𝐷𝑓).\nFormally, this objective can be written as:\nUnlearn(𝑓(𝜃𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡), 𝐷𝑓) = 𝑓(𝜃𝑢) ≈𝑓(𝜃𝑟)\n(1)\nHowever, machine unlearning faces several challenges. First, achiev-\ning selective forgetting is difficult as many existing methods [2, 6,\n14, 17, 23, 27, 34, 47] treat all training data uniformly, limiting their\nability to effectively remove specific sensitive or harmful samples.\nSecond, unlearning introduces a trade-off between forgetting ef-\nfectiveness and overall model utility: i.e., aggressively forgetting\ntargets may bring about catastrophic forgetting, degrading perfor-\nmance on the retention dataset. Third, validating that the model\nhas completely forgotten the designated samples remains open. This\npaper focuses on PII-centric data samples, integrating their associ-\nated risks into a quantifiable index during the unlearning process.\nBesides, we propose a risk assessment metric to strike a balance\namong unlearning accuracy, model utility, and generalizability.\nPII Risk Assessment. PII refers to any data that can directly or\nindirectly identify an individual, such as names, addresses, phone\nnumbers, social security numbers, and passport numbers. This type\nof information is inherently sensitive, and its exposure can lead\nto privacy breaches, legal liabilities, and ethical concerns [18, 38,\n41]. To assess the risks associated with PII exposures, authorita-\ntive institutions such as the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) [25], the Department of Homeland Security\n(DHS) [9], and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct (HIPAA) [1], have developed risk-based frameworks grounded\nin quantitative evaluation criteria. While each institution defines\nand evaluates PII risk within its respective domain, this leads to in-\nconsistencies in risk assessments across contexts and organizations.\nThis paper proposes a unified and quantifiable PII risk assessment\n1https://github.com/SecAI-Lab/unpii\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "UnPII: Unlearning Personally Identifiable Information with Quantifiable Exposure Risk\nICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nTable 1: PII categories and representative PII attribute ex-\namples of sensitive information.

We analyze major PII breach inci-\ndents [26] that are publicly available, classifying PII attributes into\n12 categories. We confirm that severe privacy risks often arise from\ncombinations of PII. For instance, the Marriott breach leaked contact\ndetails (e.g., phone numbers, email, addresses) alongside personal\nattributes (e.g., company, gender, birth date) [24]. The Facebook\nbreach exposed user IDs and phone numbers linked with names\nand location data [8]. Meanwhile, the Equifax breach revealed full\nnames, birth dates, SSNs, and addresses [10], demonstrating the\ncompounded risk of aggregated identifiers. Table 1 organizes repre-\nsentative PII attributes with their corresponding classes.\nPII Risk Factors. With a thorough analysis of risk assessment\nfrom NIST [25], DHS [9], and HIPAA [1], we carefully define seven\nrisk factors capable of capturing a distinct aspect of risk, including\nidentifiability, sensitivity, usability, linkability, permanency, expos-\nability, and compliancy as shown in Table 2. For instance, NIST\nspecifies “directly identifiable” (e.g., SSNs) and “linkable” attributes\n(e.g., ZIP codes), which map to high- and low-risk values, respec-\ntively. These factors represent flexible values, ranging from 0 to 1,\nwhich we parameterize based on institutional policies or privacy\nrequirements. Unlike existing factor-based assessments, we identify\nthe risk-driven factors tied to the exposure of each PII attribute.\nThese risk factors are configurable within a range of [0, 1], allowing\norganizations to tailor them to align with their privacy policies,\nwhich further guide the computation of per-sample unlearning in-\ntensity (§4.2). This alignment ensures stronger deletion for high-risk\nPII while permitting lighter treatment of low-risk cases, resulting in\na more cost-effective, auditable, and defensible compliance posture.\n4\nUnPII: Unlearning PII with PII Risk Index\nApproach Overview. We assume a PII-containing model and an\nunlearning dataset in the absence of a retention dataset. We in-\ntroduce UnPII, a PII-centric unlearning approach that is compatible\nwith existing unlearning methods. As illustrated in Figure 1, UnPII\noperates in three stages. First, UnPII identifies the PII exposures by\nconsulting an LLM, such as GPT-4o mini [21], to evaluate its output.\nThe rationale behind this approach builds on a recent study [32],\nwhich systematically demonstrates that LLMs outperform tradi-\ntional techniques, such as regular expressions, keyword searches,\nand entity detection, in nearly all personal information extraction\nscenarios. Second, UnPII computes a quantifiable PII risk metric for\nindividual or combined PII attributes (§4.1). To exemplify, Table 5\nin Appendix displays 10 individual and 7 combined PII attributes,\nassigning the values for seven risk factors. Third, UnPII unlearns\nthe target dataset by scaling the gradient (i.e., incorporating the\nPII risk index into a loss function), building a PII-unlearned model\n(§4.2). Notably, UnPII is designed for seamless integration with ex-\nisting approaches, including gradient ascent, negative preference\noptimization, and direct preference optimization.\n4.1\nQuantifiable Metric for PII Exposure Risk\nMetric Requirements. Designing a quantifiable risk metric for\nPII is inherently challenging due to the diverse aspects of individ-\nual PII attributes that affect their susceptibility to leakage. Besides,\nthe perception and evaluation of PII attributes may vary across\norganizations or institutions. In addition, combinations of PII can\nsignificantly amplify the risk of re-identification; e.g., the combina-\ntion of zip code, birth date, and gender can uniquely identify 87%\nof the Americans [43]. Furthermore, the metric must provide inter-\npretability in a quantitative form to support objective assessment\nand comparison, rather than relying on subjective or qualitative\nevaluations (e.g., low, medium, high).\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "ICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nIntae Jeon, Yujeong Kwon, and Hyungjoon Koo\nPII Risk\nScore\nUnPII Approach\nIdentifying PII\nOutput(PII)\nPrompting\nLLM\n1\nUnlearning PII\n3\nGradient\nScaling\n2\nComputing PRI\nPII Risk\nIndex\nPII-containing \nModel\nPII-unlearned \nModel\n(Section 4.1)\n(Section 4.2)\nFigure 1: Overall UnPII workflow for unlearning PII. Given a model (e.g., LLaMA2 [44]) that produces outputs containing PII\n(by PII-inducing questions), 1 UnPII identifies PII in the model’s output by prompting an external LLM with a tailored query\n(Table 6). 2 UnPII then computes a PII risk index (PRI) that quantifies the exposure risk, either individually or in combination\n(§4.1). 3 UnPII integrates the index into the (existing) model’s loss for unlearning via gradient scaling (§4.2), generating a\nmodel that unlearns the target PII.\nMetric Design. We design a PII risk index (PRI) to quantify the\npotential impact of exposing singular or aggregated PII attributes,\nguided by the following principles: the index should 1 capture\nmultidimensional risk factors associated with each PII attribute; 2\nemphasize elevated risk when multiple PII attributes are exposed\ntogether; and 3 express the overall risk as a normalized value in the\n(straightforward) range of (0, 1), where a higher value represents\na higher risk. This design choice enables a flexible and practical\ninterface for organizations by translating their internal privacy\npolicies into quantitative values (e.g., setting 0.9 for confidential\ndata and 0.1 for public data) through pre-defined intervals, while\npreserving the underlying algorithm unchanged.\nPII Risk Index for UnPII. We propose a PII risk index or PRI metric,\nwhich quantifies the risk associated with PII upon disclosure, which\nsatisfies the aforementioned requirements. Let 𝑅denote PRI, which\nincorporates 𝑙exposed PII attributes, each evaluated with 𝑘distinct\nrisk factors. For each attribute 𝑖and risk factor 𝑗, let 𝑎𝑖𝑗∈[0, 1]\ndenote the risk score, and 𝑤𝑖𝑗∈[0, 1] represent the corresponding\nweight reflecting the organization’s policy preferences. Each risk\nfactor assesses different dimensions of exposure risk, such as the\nuniqueness, potential harm, usefulness, linkability, breadth, and\nlegal consequences (Table 2). Organizations may assign zero weight\nto disregard certain dimensions (e.g., 𝑤𝑗for usability). The weights\nmust be properly normalized such that Í𝑘\n𝑗=1 𝑤𝑗= 1. Then, the\nindividual risk 𝑟is computed by aggregating the weighted risk\nscores via an inner product across risk factors and a summation\nacross all attributes. We parameterize the lambda term (𝜆= 0.025)\nto prevent premature saturation of the risk index towards 1.0 when\nthe number of attributes is small, ensuring that gradient scaling\nremains sensitive to the addition of new risk factors.\n𝑟= 𝜆𝑘𝑙+\n𝑙∑︁\n𝑖=1\n𝑘\nÖ\n𝑗=1\n𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑎𝑖𝑗\n(2)\nThe additive term (𝜆𝑘𝑙) compensates for counterintuitive risk di-\nlution as the number of attributes or factors increases.

Notably, PRI nears 1.0 under exposures of five or\nmore PII attributes, while maintaining a low standard deviation.\n4.2\nUnPII: Unlearning PII with its Risk Index\nBy design, UnPII can be seamlessly integrated with other machine\nunlearning techniques. To enhance the efficiency of eliminating\nPII attributes, we adopt gradient scaling [28] that assists in stabiliz-\ning the selective gradient updates when unlearning a small subset\nof data samples. Indeed, different unlearning models incorporate\ncustomized loss functions to control the forgetting rate: i.e., by\namplifying the forgetting signal while mitigating unintended side\neffects on retention data. In this paper, we apply three optimization-\nbased unlearning techniques: GA [23], NPO [47], and DPO [34]. In\nessence, once PII attribute(s) are revealed, UnPII computes the cor-\nresponding PRIs (§4.1), followed by plugging them into a tailored\nloss that can guide a model to unlearn them.\nLoss Function in Gradient Ascent. The primary goal is to derive\nthe model 𝜋𝜃for unlearning by updating the pre-trained model 𝜋\nto forget PII, using the forget set 𝐷𝑓= {𝑥𝑓,𝑦𝑓}, where 𝑥𝑓and 𝑦𝑓\nrepresent the forget prompt and forget response, respectively. The\nloss associated with 𝐷𝑓is increased using gradient ascent, which\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "UnPII: Unlearning Personally Identifiable Information with Quantifiable Exposure Risk\nICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nprevents 𝜋𝜃from generating 𝑦𝑓.

The outer sigmoid function 𝜎smooths the\nloss landscape and bounds the gradients, which contributes to stable\noptimization. The approach is designed to reverse the preference\nbehavior learned from 𝐷𝑓, with 𝛽regulating the strength of the\nregularization.\nLDPO ¤= −2\n𝛽log𝜎\n\u0012\n𝛽log 𝜋𝜃(𝑦𝑝| 𝑥𝑓)\n𝜋(𝑦𝑝| 𝑥𝑓) −𝛽log 𝜋𝜃(𝑦𝑓| 𝑥𝑓)\n𝜋(𝑦𝑓| 𝑥𝑓)\n\u0013\n(6)\nGradient Scaling in UnPII. The gist of UnPII lies in its gradient\nscaling mechanism, which dynamically adjusts a base loss function,\nLbase, according to the PII Risk Index (𝑅𝑝). The final loss function\nis defined by multiplying Lbase with a PRI-based scaling factor as\nfollows:\nLUnPII = Lbase(1 + 𝑅𝑝) where Lbase ∈{LGA, LNPO, LDPO}\n(7)\nNote that the risk index 𝑅𝑝is computed individually for each sample\nwithin an unlearning batch. Consequently, the scaling operates at\nthe per-sample level: each sample’s loss is modulated by (1+𝑅𝑝), and\nthe final batch loss is obtained by aggregating these risk-weighted\nterms (e.g., via mean or sum). The scaling factor directly controls\nthe strength of forgetting in proportion to the quantified PII risk: a\nhigher-risk PII corresponds to a larger 𝑅𝑝, thereby amplifying the\nassociated loss and producing stronger gradient signals for unlearn-\ning. In our experiments, we instantiate UnPII to three different base\nlosses: 𝐿GA, 𝐿NPO, and 𝐿DPO.\n5\nEvaluation\nWe evaluate UnPII with varying experiments on a 64-bit Ubuntu\n22.04 system with an AMD EPYC 7763 CPU @ 2.45GHz, 1TB RAM,\nand a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB of graphics memory.\nResearch Questions.

Besides, how\ndoes UnPII affect the balance among performance metrics under\nvarying settings (§5.2)?\n• (RQ2) How consistently does UnPII perform across different un-\nlearning instances (e.g., using random sampling) (§5.3)?\n• (RQ3) How efficient is UnPII across different unlearning approaches,\nincluding GA, DPO, and NPO (§5.4)?\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDataset Construction. We construct a synthetic PII dataset using\nGPT-4o [31], as no existing pseudo-PII dataset meets the needs\nof our study. To prevent any association with real individuals, all\nprompts are carefully crafted to generate entirely artificial data. We\nchose 10 representative PII attributes from each category in Table 1,\nalong with 7 combinations of these attributes, resulting in 1,700\nsamples (100 per attribute or combination). While UnPII allows for\nparameterizing risk dimensions according to institutional policy,\nfor this experiment, we leverage GPT-4o [31] to assign values across\nseven risk dimensions, assuming its semantic understanding reflects\nreal-world interpretations. Table 5 in Appendix summarizes the as-\nsigned risk factor and the resulting PRI based on Equation 3, using\n𝑘= 7 and 𝜆= 0.025. As a final note, we define three datasets based\non different forgetting ratios: forget01, forget05, and forget10 cor-\nrespond to 1% (17 samples), 5% (85 samples), and 10% (170 samples)\nof the 1,700-sample dataset, respectively. The prompts for data\ngeneration are displayed in Appendix Table 4.\nUnlearning Validity. In the absence of a universally accepted\nmethod for validating unlearning status, we adopt a two-step match-\ning strategy tailored to the structural properties of each PII attribute:\npattern matching and semantic matching. The first step applies pat-\ntern matching to detect structured PII attributes such as phone\nnumbers and social security numbers. We use pre-defined regular\nexpressions to identify such instances; if a model’s output matches\nthe pattern and contains the correct value, it is considered a failure\nto forget, otherwise a success. The second step applies semantic\nmatching for other unstructured PII attributes, including names,\naddresses, and hospital records. We leverage a commercial large lan-\nguage model (e.g., GPT-4o mini [32]) to assess whether the model’s\noutput contains any explicit or implicit PII-related instances. Table 7\nin Appendix shows prompt examples for evaluation.\nEvaluation Metrics for Unlearning. Building on the unlearning\nvalidation approaches described above, we introduce three key met-\nrics to assess unlearning performance: accuracy (A), utility (U), and\ngeneralizability (G). First, accuracy quantifies the model’s ability\nto effectively forget targeted PII attributes, evaluated on the un-\nlearning dataset. Second, utility measures the extent to which the\nmodel preserves performance on non-PII content after unlearning.\nThird, generalizability captures whether the model forgets PII in\nunseen instances present during training but excluded from the un-\nlearning set. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of unlearning\nquality, we report H-AUG, the harmonic mean of accuracy, utility,\nand generalization as the following equation.\nH-AUG =\n3\n1\n𝐴+ 1\n𝑈+ 1\n𝐺\n(8)\nThis formulation promotes balanced unlearning by penalizing the\noverall score when any individual metric is low.

As\ndepicted in Figure 3, UnPII yields overall improvements in H-AUG\n(up to 5%) compared to the baseline unlearning approaches.\nPerformance Enhancement Across Unlearning Approaches.\nApproach-wise, Figure 5 highlights notable differences in the effec-\ntiveness of each technique. The DPO [34] approach exhibits strong\nperformance in the early steps at the 10% forgetting ratio, but shows\na sharp decline after a certain threshold; in contrast, DPO+UnPII\ndemonstrates a more gradual performance degradation across in-\ntervals. The NPO [47] approach maintains a relatively high average\nperformance and remains stable throughout the mid-steps under\nthe 5% and 10% forgetting ratios. Yet, under the 1% forgetting ratio,\nit experiences a quick performance drop in the later steps following\nan initial rise. Similarly, this pattern is observed in NPO+UnPII.\nMeanwhile, both GA [23] and GA+UnPII display substantial early-\nstep improvements under certain conditions.\nDecomposed Performance Analysis: Accuracy, Utility, and\nGeneralizability. We decompose H-AUG into individual perfor-\nmance metrics for all baseline methods. Figure 4 demonstrates that\nUnPII achieves the improvements of accuracy up to 11.8%, utility up\nto 6.3%, and generalizability up to 12.4%, respectively. The forget-\nting accuracies of models integrated with UnPII mostly surpass the\nbaselines by around 5% at each step, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nLikewise, incorporating UnPII positively impacts model utilities:\ne.g., DPO+UnPII and NPO+UnPII exhibit up to 8% performance\nenhancements over their baselines, while GA+UnPII with a modest\ngain of around 2%. Furthermore, UnPII contributes to generaliz-\nability (evaluated on an unseen dataset), with improvement of up\nto approximately 3% compared to each baseline.

No-\ntably, larger solid triangle areas indicate that UnPII enhances\noverall performance across most configurations.\nand GA+UnPII, illustrating that GA+UnPII converges slightly faster\nin unlearning high-risk PII attributes. Notably, we observe certain\nconfigurations, such as GA+UnPII with the forget05 dataset, devi-\nate from overall trends, which we discuss in §7.\n5.3\nConsistency of UnPII on Different\nUnlearning Samples\nThis section evaluates the performance consistency of the UnPII ap-\nproach when trained on different unlearning samples and integrated\nwith existing unlearning methods: e.g., the original forgetting set\n(𝐷𝑓) and a re-sampled forgetting set (𝐷𝑟). To this end, we compare\nthe two models trained on 𝐷𝑓and 𝐷𝑟across varying forgetting ra-\ntios (e.g., 1%, 5%, 10%). The re-sampled sets are constructed to ensure\nthat at least one PII attribute from each category is included. This\nexperiment aims to confirm whether the performance of the un-\nlearned model (UnPII) remains persistent, regardless of unlearning\ndata samples. As illustrated in Figure 5, H-AUG remains largely con-\nsistent in most cases, indicating that UnPII is robust to variations\nin the composition of unlearning instances.\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "UnPII: Unlearning Personally Identifiable Information with Quantifiable Exposure Risk\nICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nH-AUG (Forget01)\nDPO\nDPO+UnPII\nNPO\nNPO+UnPII\nGA\nGA+UnPII\nDf\nDr\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nH-AUG (Forget05)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nH-AUG (Forget10)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nStep\nFigure 5: Comparison of unlearning performance between the original unlearning dataset (𝐷𝑓) and a randomly re-sampled\ndataset (𝐷𝑟) for GA [23], NPO [47], and DPO [34], with and without our UnPII technique across different forgetting ratios\n(forget10, forget05, forget01). Blue lines indicate results on 𝐷𝑓, and orange lines represent results on 𝐷𝑟. Despite marginal\nvariations in the dataset composition, the overall performance remains consistent (Section 5.3).\n5.4\nEfficiency of UnPII\nWe assess the efficiency of UnPII by measuring fine-tuning du-\nrations over 20 unlearning steps across different unlearning ap-\nproaches. As shown in Table 3, the overall overhead averages 27.5%\nwith increases of 21.6% for GA (465.7s →562.0s), 25.3% for DPO\n(628.1s →790.1s), and 35.6% for NPO (474.4s →642.3s). However,\nthis overhead is relatively modest compared to retraining the entire\nmodel from scratch: e.g., the original LLaMA2 7B required 184, 320\nGPU hours. Detecting PII via the GPT-4o-mini [32] interface (i.e.,\nAPI) causes dominant overheads; however, it incurs an inexpen-\nsive cost of only $0.01 (e.g., 320 API calls) across the entire run.\nNotably, memory usage remains identical between baselines with\nand without UnPII.\n6\nImplementation\nPII-containing Model for UnPII. We train the PII-containing\nmodel on our in-house synthetic dataset, which include 1,700 cases\nthat contain 17 PII attributes, using the LLaMA2 7B [44] model\nimplemented via the Hugging Face Transformers library [46]. For\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning, we employed the LoRA [13] tech-\nnique, which introduces two hyperparameters: 𝑟, the rank of the\nlow-dimensional matrices to approximate weight updates, and 𝛼, a\nscaling factor applied to these updates. We set 𝑟= 16 and 𝛼= 32\nin our experiments. The model has been optimized using AdamW\nwith a learning rate of 2 × 10−4 and a weight decay of 0.01, trained\nfor 30 epochs with a batch size of 16.\nFigure 6: Comparison of forget accuracy over training\nsteps for different UnPII-applied unlearning techniques:\nDPO+UnPII, NPO+UnPII, and GA+UnPII. Each heatmap rep-\nresents the progress of unlearning PII attributes (order by\nPRI values), with a transition from dark to light colors. While\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of UnPII with all unlearning\napproaches, we observe that incorporating UnPII with GA\noutperforms than others slightly.\nPII-unlearned Model with Baseline Unlearning Approaches.\nWe train three PII-unlearned models for UnPII on the following\nthree baseline approaches: GA [23], NPO [47] and DPO [34].

The empirical evaluation pri-\nmarily relies on (in-house) synthetic datasets to simulate controlled\nPII exposure scenarios. While an artificial dataset allows for system-\natic and reproducible analysis, it may not fully capture real-world\ncomplexities such as data noise and sparsity, the distribution of class\nimbalance, long-tail formats, or locale-specific identifiers. Addition-\nally, the process of generating synthetic samples using GPT-4o has\ninherent limitations, as it may have created attributes that are factu-\nally incorrect or inconsistent, such as an address with a mismatched\ncity and ZIP code, or an identification number with a non-standard\nformat. Hence, further validation on real-world datasets from di-\nverse domains (e.g., healthcare, finance) is essential to assess the\npractical applicability and robustness of the proposed approach.\nLimitations on Defining Risk Factors. While authoritative guide-\nlines serve as our proxy for expertise, the defined risk factors may\nnot precisely correspond to real-world compliance standards across\ndiverse domains and viewpoints, as our work lacks direct legal\nreview or validation from domain experts.\nUnlearning Assessment Metric. As discussed in 5.1, defining a\nstandard metric for evaluating whether a data point has been truly\nforgotten through unlearning remains an open challenge. Existing\napproaches rely on empirical proxies to evaluate unlearning effec-\ntiveness, such as membership inference attack-based metrics [40],\nwhich tests whether an adversary can infer the presence of a data\npoint in the training set, and retraining comparisons, which mea-\nsures the divergence in output distributions between the unlearned\nmodel and a reference model from scratch without the target data\npoint. Although our proposed H-AUG metric offers a more holistic\nassessment by moving beyond isolated performance measures, we\nnote that it does not constitute a worst-case guarantee of forget-\nting. Meanwhile, our unlearning evaluation relies on a commercial\nLLM (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to determine the presence of PII-related\ninstances, which may introduce performance variability.\nGeneralization of UnPII. In theory, UnPII can be incorporated\nby any gradient ascent–oriented unlearning method. However, our\nobservations indicate that the integration of UnPII with different\nunlearning approaches may result in performance variations. We\nhypothesize that UnPII selectively amplifies gradient updates (Equa-\ntion 7) for high-risk PII attributes, which synergizes with a simple\nnegative log-likelihood loss function (Equation 4), such as in GA. By\ncomparison, intermediary transformations, such as sigmoid-based\nprobabilities in DPO (Equation 6) and NPO (Equation 5) may reduce\nthe direct impact of the scaling factor. As part of our future work,\nwe plan to explore the integration of UnPII with other unlearn-\ning paradigms, including parameter-efficient adapter modules (e.g.,\nEUL [6], ExtSub [14]), dynamic pruning techniques, or alternative\npreference-optimization approaches (e.g., AltPO [27]).\nHyperparameter Exploration. Orthogonally to our main ap-\nproach, the performance of machine unlearning techniques is often\nsensitive to hyperparameter settings. Identifying optimal config-\nurations typically requires significant effort due to the large hy-\nperparameter search space. For instance, we observe performance\ndegradation in GA+UnPII on the forget05 dataset, underlining the\nimpact of hyperparameter choices on unlearning efficacy. Further\nexperiments demonstrate that adjusting the 𝜆value in PRI from\n0.025 to 0.0125 yields a notable performance improvement from\n86.05 to 89.24. In a similar vein, the scaling factor 𝛽must be care-\nfully tuned for NPO [47] and DPO [34]: i.e., overly large values\nmay lead to excessive forgetting of relevant information, while too\nsmall values may fail to adequately unlearn sensitive PII. Mean-\nwhile, prior works [22, 23] empirically reveal that the forget size, as\nanother hyperparameter, can significantly affect unlearning perfor-\nmance, which aligns with our experiments. We leave the broader\nchallenge of hyperparameter calibration, particularly in the context\nof gradient scaling [28], as an open research problem.\nPRI Quantification and Risk Factors toward Industrial Adop-\ntion. Our study accounts for varying risk factors; however, we\nacknowledge that reducing the complexity of real-world risk to a\nbounded range of (0, 1) may involve over-simplification. Moreover,\nalthough our empirical setup leverages GPT-4o to assign weights\nsimulating a realistic risk assessment based on general semantic\nunderstanding, this approach may introduce potential biases, rather\nthan strictly adhering to organizational policies. To safely apply\nUnPII to real-world logs, human-in-the-loop auditing and continu-\nous monitoring mechanisms should be incorporated to verify the\neffectiveness, guiding refinement of risk factors and thresholds.\nEstablishing compliance review procedures and validation with the\ndomain experts (e.g., privacy officers, legal teams, data stewards)\nis essential to ensure alignment with regulatory and operational\nrequirements.\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "UnPII: Unlearning Personally Identifiable Information with Quantifiable Exposure Risk\nICSE-SEIP ’26, April 12–18, 2026, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n8\nRelated Work\nRetraining-based Unlearning. Early efforts in machine unlearn-\ning focused on retraining models from scratch upon deletion re-\nquests. SISA [2] reduces retraining costs by partitioning the dataset\ninto independent shards and retraining only the affected ones.\nWhile this improves computational efficiency, it can result in a bias\ndue to differences in data distributions across shards. FairSISA [17]\naddresses this issue by applying post-processing bias mitigation\ntechniques to enhance fairness. However, this approach is imprac-\ntical for LLMs with billions of parameters trained on terabyte-scale\ndatasets, as it is computationally expensive and the original training\ndata is not available, which makes dataset partitioning infeasible.\nGradient-based Unlearning. Without retraining the entire model,\nthe impact of an unlearning set can be mitigated by updating model\nparameters using gradient signals derived from the set. GA [23]\nmaximizes the loss on the unlearning set, reversing its learned in-\nfluence and guiding the model to forget the associated information.\nHowever, relying solely on gradients from the unlearning set may\ninadvertently affect knowledge from the retention set, leading to\ndegradation in overall performance. To address this, 𝐺𝐴RT [3, 39]\ncomputes gradient differences between the unlearning and reten-\ntion sets, allowing for more targeted updates that reduce collateral\neffects. 𝐺𝐴KL [39] further enhances stability by introducing a KL-\ndivergence [19] regularization term that encourages preservation of\nthe model’s original output distribution. These approaches facilitate\nefficient data removal in large-scale models through selective and\nlocalized parameter updates, avoiding the need for full retraining.\nNote that we use GA in our experiments.\nPreference Optimization-based Unlearning. Rather than di-\nrectly optimizing the loss on the unlearning set, preference opti-\nmization based [23, 27, 34, 47] unlearning modifies model behavior\nby adjusting preference signals derived from feedback. NPO [47]\nprovides negative feedback by treating the model’s original re-\nsponses on the unlearning set as undesirable and training the model\nto avoid reproducing them. DPO [34] extends NPO by generating\nan alternative response for each unlearning sample, treating it as\nthe preferred output. Then, the model receives positive feedback\non the alternative response and negative feedback on the original\nresponse, thereby generating the preferred alternative. IdkPO [23]\nbuilds on DPO by uniformly applying the response “I don’t know”\nas the alternative response for all unlearning queries. However, this\nfixed-response strategy can lead to unnatural outputs and overcon-\nfidence, increasing the risk of misinformation. To mitigate these\nlimitations, AltPO [27] employs a commercial LLM (e.g., GPT-4o\nmini [32]) to generate context-appropriate alternative responses, en-\nhancing naturalness and mitigates overconfidence. Overall, prefer-\nence optimization-based approaches offer computational efficiency\nwithout requiring a retention set, making them well-suited to our\nsetting. Accordingly, we adopt NPO and DPO in our experiments.\nParameter-efficient Fine-tuning Unlearning. The PEFT [11]\napproach allows for efficient adaptation of fine-tuning a large\npre-trained model by updating only a small subset of parameters,\nthereby reducing computational cost while supporting domain-\nspecific fine-tuning. Recent work in machine unlearning leverages\nPEFT by training lightweight module to forget a target unlearning\nset. EUL [6] introduces adapter modules (i.e., unlearning layers)\nto Transformers [45] and fine-tunes them for unlearning. How-\never, EUL depends on a retention set to preserve overall model\nperformance, which does not align with our assumption. Similarly,\nExtSub [14] trains two separately fine-tuned models: an expert\nmodel trained on a general-purpose dataset and an anti-expert\nmodel on the unlearning set, which assumes that the expert model\nmay still retain residual influence from the unlearning set. ExtSub\nidentifies the shared components between two models as general\ncapabilities, regarding the differences as attributable to the unlearn-\ning set. In our study, we apply PEFT to fine-tune a PII-containing\nmodel for unlearning purposes; however, we exclude PEFT-based\napproaches from our baselines due to their reliance on additional\nreference.\n9\nConclusion\nIn this work, we present UnPII, a PII-centric unlearning approach\nby leveraging a privacy risk-based assessment. In a nutshell, UnPII\nincorporates a PII risk index into the unlearning process for the\nrecognized PII attributes in a PII-containing model. Namely, UnPII\ndynamically adjusts forgetting strength based on the privacy sen-\nsitivity of each PII attribute, ensuring effective privacy protection\nwith minimal impact on model performance. Our empirical evalua-\ntions demonstrate that UnPII outperforms baseline methods such\nas Gradient Ascent, Negative Preference Optimization, and Direct\nPreference Optimization approaches, improving the harmonic mean\nof accuracy, utility, and generalizability, with a modest fine-tuning\noverhead for unlearning.\nEthics Consideration\nTo ensure realistic and diverse PII characteristics, we analyze the\npublicly available Enron Email Dataset [5] to derive statistical distri-\nbutions of name-related features (e.g., frequency, length, character\nn-grams). These empirical statistics are used solely to parameterize\nthe sampling of synthetic names; no concrete identifiers from the\ndataset have been replicated. For other identifiers, we adopted con-\ntrolled synthetic generation strategies. For instance, we generate\n(seemingly-benign) addresses by randomly pairing U.S. cities with\nstates, while domain-specific rules are applied to enforce actual for-\nmats (e.g., social security numbers following the 3–2–4 structure).\nConsequently, all identifiers appearing in our experiments are fully\nsynthetic and contain no real-world personal information.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback.\nThis work was partially supported by the grants from Institute of\nInformation & Communications Technology Planning & Evalua-\ntion (IITP), funded by the Korean government (MSIT; Ministry of\nScience and ICT): No. RS-2024-00337414 and No. RS-2024-00437306.\nAdditional support was provided by the Basic Science Research\nProgram through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF),\nfunded by the Ministry of Education of the Government of South\nKorea : No. RS-2025-02293072.
