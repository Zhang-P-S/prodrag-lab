In these settings, reliability is not\nonly about whether a model can produce a plausible\nrecommendation, but also whether it behaves consis-\ntently when users express the same intent in different\nsurface forms. Yet most existing safety and alignment\nevaluations treat a prompt as a single static query,\nimplicitly assuming that benign rephrasings do not\nmaterially change the underlying decision. This as-\nsumption is fragile: everyday users routinely introduce\nnegation (“should not”), double-negation (“should\nnot refuse”), and conditional goal/action formulations\n(“save X even if Y”), and these syntactic choices can\nyield logically equivalent statements.\nThis paper studies a narrowly defined but con-\nsequential robustness question: Do LLMs preserve\nethical judgments under a specified class of syntac-\ntic transformations that are logically equivalent up\nto polarity? Concretely, consider a dilemma where\nthe model is asked whether an agent should take\nan action. A model that agrees with “They should\ndo A” but disagrees with “They should not refuse\nto do A” has not changed its moral stance for sub-\nstantive reasons—it has failed an invariance property\nunder polarity-bearing syntax. Such failures are oper-\nationally important: they can cause user-dependent\noutcomes, undermine auditability, and create a com-\npliance risk in regulated environments where decision\nrationales must be stable under restatement.\nA central challenge is separating syntactic framing\neffects from semantic drift. Many “prompt sensitivity”\nand paraphrase robustness studies perturb prompts\nin ways that subtly shift meaning, pragmatics, or\nimplicature, making it unclear whether observed dif-\nferences reflect genuine preference changes or artifact.\nWe therefore introduce Syntactic Framing Fragility\n(SFF), an audit framework that isolates pure syn-\ntactic polarity effects by pairing each scenario with\na small set of programmatic framings and applying\nLogical Polarity Normalization (LPN) to map each\nPreprint.\n1\narXiv:2601.09724v1  [cs.CL]  27 Dec 2025\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "(framing, response) into a common notion of action\nendorsement. This allows direct comparison of deci-\nsions across positive and negative surface forms while\nholding dilemma content constant.\nUsing SFF, we audit 23 models (in three groups:\nSOTA commercial US and Chinese models as well as\nsmall US open-source software (OSS) models) on 14\nethical scenarios across 7 domains, with four controlled\nframings per scenario and repeated sampling (39,975\nvalid decisions). We find that syntactic inconsistency\nis widespread and often large: for many models, the\nprobability of endorsing an action varies sharply across\nlogically equivalent framings, and these differences\nare frequently statistically significant under within-\nscenario tests. Strikingly, open-source models exhibit\nsubstantially higher fragility than commercial models,\nand we observe extreme failures under negation where\nsome models endorse an action at very high rates even\nwhen asked whether the agent should not perform it.\nThese patterns suggest that a nontrivial portion of\n“ethical behavior” observed in common evaluations\nmay be contingent on surface-form artifacts rather\nthan stable normative reasoning.\nBeyond diagnosis, we examine an actionable mit-\nigation lever: eliciting explicit step-by-step reason-\ning reduces measured fragility under our protocol,\nindicating that additional deliberation can partially\ncounteract polarity-triggered instability. Finally, we\nmap fragility across domains and scenarios to identify\nhigher-risk deployment contexts and to provide practi-\ntioners with concrete guidance about where syntactic\nrobustness is most likely to fail.\nThis work argues that syntactic consistency under\nlogical equivalence constitutes a distinct and practi-\ncally important dimension of LLM trustworthiness.\nWe present: (1) a controlled evaluation framework\n(Syntactic Framing Fragility, SFF) targeting polarity-\nbearing syntactic transformations; (2) a normalization\nmethod (Logical Polarity Normalization, LPN) and an\neffect-size metric (SVI) for quantifying inconsistency;\n(3) a large-scale cross-origin audit of contemporary\nmodels; and (4) empirical evidence of pronounced\nnegation sensitivity and partial mitigation via rea-\nsoning elicitation. Together, these results support\nincorporating SFF-style audits into LLM evaluation\npipelines for consequential decision support. Specifi-\ncally, our contributions are:\n• Formalize ethical robustness as invariance under\na specified class of logically equivalent, polarity-\nbearing syntactic transformations.\n• Introduce SFF and LPN to isolate syntactic fram-\ning effects from semantic drift, and propose SVI\nto quantify per-scenario instability.\n• Conduct an empirical audit of 23 models across\nthree origin categories on 14 scenarios using re-\npeated sampling and within-subject statistical\ntesting.\n• Quantify widespread fragility, pronounced nega-\ntion sensitivity (especially in open-weight mod-\nels), partial mitigation via reasoning elicitation,\nand scenario-dependent risk patterns relevant to\ndeployment.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nFraming effects and logical equiva-\nlence\nFraming effects in human judgment—such as gain/loss\nasymmetries and wording-dependent preference re-\nversals—are a foundational motivation for this work\n(Tversky and Kahneman, 1981). In the context of\nlarge language models (LLMs), many prior “framing”\nstudies vary surface phrasing in ways that inadver-\ntently alter semantic content, pragmatic implicature,\nor presuppositions, making it difficult to attribute\nobserved behavioral changes to syntax alone (Sclar\net al., 2024; Chun and Elkins, 2024).\nSFF targets a narrower and more formally grounded\ninvariance class: logically equivalent polarity and con-\nditional restructurings of the same ethical dilemma.\nBy constraining variation to transformations that pre-\nserve decision-theoretic content after Logical Polarity\nNormalization (LPN), SFF enables robustness claims\ncloser to semantic invariance under a specified trans-\nformation group, rather than generic paraphrase sen-\nsitivity.\n2.2\nRobustness auditing beyond static\nbenchmarks\nA growing body of evaluation research argues that\nstatic benchmark scores are structurally insufficient\nfor generative systems, and that robustness should\ninstead be assessed as stability under perturbation\nwith explicit statistical controls (Rauba et al., 2025).\nRecent audit-style frameworks formalize LLM eval-\nuation as a hypothesis-testing problem over output\ndistributions, often using repeated sampling and non-\nparametric tests to detect instability under controlled\nperturbations (Rauba et al., 2024).\nThis statistical auditing perspective directly moti-\nvates SFF’s repeated-sampling design and its use of\nCochran’s Q test with false discovery rate correction\nfor within-scenario, within-model comparisons. The\nPreprint.\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "key distinction is that prior audit frameworks primar-\nily operationalize robustness as resistance to semantic\ndrift under broad perturbations, whereas SFF isolates\nsyntactic polarity variation while holding dilemma\ncontent fixed via LPN.\n2.3\nPrompt sensitivity, multi-prompt\nevaluation, and variance estima-\ntion\nA substantial literature demonstrates that LLM out-\nputs can vary significantly under superficial prompt\nchanges, including formatting, ordering, and exemplar\nchoice in few-shot settings (Zhao et al., 2021; Sclar\net al., 2024). In response, recent work has argued for\nmulti-prompt evaluation as a first-class methodology:\nrather than treating a single prompt as representative,\nperformance should be estimated across prompt sets\nto capture variance and improve reliability (Polo et al.,\n2024).\nSFF aligns closely with this methodological shift\nby treating syntactic variation as the primary object\nof study. It contributes (1) a logically specified in-\nvariance target (polarity- and condition-preserving\nreformulations after LPN), and (2) a decision-centric\neffect size (SVI) tailored to ethical action endorsement\nconsistency rather than general task accuracy.\n2.4\nNegation sensitivity and polarity-\naware measurement\nNegation has long been recognized as a linguistic\nstressor for NLP systems, and recent work suggests\nthat modern aligned LLMs may behave like surface-\ntrigger classifiers in safety-relevant regimes, respond-\ning to salient keywords rather than to the composi-\ntional semantics of negated statements (Sadiekh et al.,\n2025). Polarity-aware probing methods explicitly test\nwhether internal representations and behavioral judg-\nments invert appropriately under polarity flips, po-\nsitioning latent alignment as something measurable\nunder controlled transformations.\nSFF’s empirical finding of extreme failures on\nnegation-bearing framings—particularly among open-\nweight models—is conceptually consistent with this\nline of work. Rather than probing internal representa-\ntions, SFF measures a behavioral analogue of polarity\nconsistency by normalizing decisions under LPN and\nquantifying residual instability across polarity-bearing\nframes.\n2.5\nEthical reasoning benchmarks vs.\nconsistency as a robustness dimen-\nsion\nEthical reasoning benchmarks such as ETHICS\n(Hendrycks et al., 2021) and broader trustworthiness\nevaluations such as DecodingTrust (Wang et al., 2023)\nprimarily measure capability: whether models can se-\nlect or justify normatively appropriate outputs. More\nrecent frameworks and surveys emphasize breadth\nacross safety dimensions, including generalized safety\nevaluation pipelines (Jindal et al., 2025) and compre-\nhensive trustworthiness reviews (Liu et al., 2024).\nSFF is complementary to this literature. It targets\nconsistency under logically equivalent syntactic trans-\nformations, which is not captured by single-prompt\nmoral capability scores. In consequential decision con-\ntexts, inconsistency itself constitutes a failure mode:\ntwo users posing the “same” ethical question via dif-\nferent syntactic polarity may receive contradictory\nrecommendations, undermining accountability and\nprocedural fairness (Dwork et al., 2012).\n2.6\nSoftware testing and metamorphic\nrelations for LLMs\nA parallel research direction reframes LLM evalua-\ntion through the lens of software testing, emphasizing\nproperty-based testing, invariance checks, and meta-\nmorphic relations (Racharak et al., 2025).\nUnder\nthis view, reliable systems should satisfy specified\ninput–output relations even when inputs are trans-\nformed in logically irrelevant ways.\nSFF fits naturally into this paradigm. Its set of\npolarity and conditional transformations can be in-\nterpreted as a metamorphic relation that an ethical\ndecision system ought to satisfy. Where prior work\nprovides general testing principles and task-agnostic\nworkflows, SFF contributes a scenario-specific, logi-\ncally grounded metamorphic relation (via LPN) to-\ngether with a scalar instability metric (SVI) that sup-\nports model ranking, cross-origin comparison, and\ndeployment risk analysis.\n2.7\nOperational toolkits for prompt-\nvariation robustness\nFinally, the ecosystem for prompt-robustness evalu-\nation has matured into reusable tooling for pertur-\nbation generation, prompt variation, and behavioral\ntesting. Libraries such as PromptBench standardize\nevaluation across prompt transformations including\nnegation and paraphrasing (Zhu et al., 2024). More\nbroadly, LLM scanners, checklists, and robustness\nPreprint.\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "toolkits provide practical infrastructure for reliability\nand security assessment.\nThese tools are not substitutes for a logically\ngrounded invariance target, but they make SFF-style\naudits operationally reproducible and extensible by\nlowering the cost of systematic prompt variation and\nrepeated evaluation.\n2.8\nPositioning\nPrior work motivates (1) framing as a source of sys-\ntematic preference shifts (Tversky and Kahneman,\n1981), (2) robustness auditing as distributional stabil-\nity under perturbations with statistical rigor (Rauba\net al., 2025, 2024), (3) multi-prompt variance estima-\ntion as a core evaluation practice (Polo et al., 2024),\n(4) polarity-aware measurement as an emerging lens\non negation failures (Sadiekh et al., 2025), and (5)\nsoftware-testing perspectives that treat invariances as\ntestable properties (Racharak et al., 2025).\nSFF advances this landscape by transforming\nprompt sensitivity into a robustness dimension that is\nlogically specified, statistically testable, and directly\nactionable for deployment risk assessment.\n3\nMethodology\nOur objective is to measure whether large language\nmodels (LLMs) preserve ethical action endorsement\nunder a controlled class of logically equivalent but syn-\ntactically different prompts.

For each combination, we draw\nn = 30 independent samples, yielding 42,767 valid\ndecisions after filtering. All prompts are executed as\nindependent API calls with no conversational memory.\nModels are drawn from three origin categories: com-\nmerical SOTA US (SOTA US), commercial SOTA\nChinese (SOTA CN), and small US OSS models\n(SM US OSS) used for aggregate analysis. The full\nlist of included and excluded models, versions, and\naccess modalities is provided in Appendix A.\n3.2\nEthical Scenarios\nWe evaluate 14 ethical dilemmas spanning 7 domains,\nincluding medical, financial, business, legal, interper-\nsonal, public policy, and safety-critical contexts. Sce-\nnarios are short, self-contained, and designed to avoid\ndependence on specialized factual knowledge. Impor-\ntantly, we do not assume a uniquely correct moral\nanswer; the audit measures consistency under logical\nequivalence, not moral correctness.

Following\nrobustness-audit practice, we interpret SVI as an effect\nsize on the probability scale rather than as a binary\nsuccess metric, and we report categorical summaries\nonly to aid interpretability rather than to define deci-\nsion thresholds (Rauba et al., 2025, 2024). Specifically,\nSVI ≥0.5 is labeled high fragility, corresponding to\ncases where action endorsement probabilities differ by\nat least 50 percentage points across logically equivalent\nframes, an effect size that would constitute a decisive\nbehavioral shift in audit-style evaluations. Values in\nthe range [0.2, 0.5) are labeled moderate fragility, re-\nflecting non-trivial but smaller distributional shifts,\nwhile SVI < 0.2 is labeled robust, indicating near-\ninvariance under the tested syntactic transformations.\nThese cutoffs are fixed a priori and are not tuned to\nmaximize significance or separation; they serve only as\ndescriptive bins over a continuous robustness measure,\nconsistent with prior work that emphasizes distribu-\ntional stability under perturbation rather than point\nestimates of accuracy (Rauba et al., 2025; Polo et al.,\n2024). Under this scheme, 45.2% of pairs exhibit high\nfragility, 41.8% moderate fragility, and only 13.0% are\nrobust.

While reasoning elicitation can\nreduce fragility, benefits are conditional. Overall, syn-\ntactic invariance emerges as a critical dimension of\nLLM trustworthiness that should be evaluated along-\nside ethical capability in deployment-critical settings.\nImpact Statement\nThis work studies the robustness of large language\nmodels under syntactically different but logically\nequivalent prompts in ethical decision scenarios. By\nidentifying systematic instability, particularly under\nnegation-bearing constructions, we highlight a failure\nmode that can undermine reliability, fairness, and\naccountability when LLMs are used in consequential\nsettings such as finance, law, education, or health-\ncare. The proposed Syntactic Framing Fragility (SFF)\nframework is intended as an evaluation and auditing\ntool rather than a deployment mechanism: it does not\nintroduce new capabilities, nor does it advocate spe-\ncific decision outcomes. Instead, it provides practition-\ners and auditors with a way to detect inconsistencies\nthat may otherwise go unnoticed under single-prompt\nevaluation. We anticipate that improved robustness\nauditing can help reduce unintended harms arising\nfrom brittle model behavior, while also informing safer\ndeployment practices. At the same time, our findings\nunderscore the need for caution when interpreting\nmodel outputs in high-stakes contexts, as syntactic\nsensitivity may lead to divergent recommendations\neven in the absence of adversarial intent.\nPreprint.\n10\n"}, {"page": 11, "text": "References\nJon Chun and Katherine Elkins.

The\ngoal is to (1) make distributional patterns visible beyond point estimates, (2) expose secondary phenomena\n(e.g., scaling and compliance relationships), and (3) document model-family- and scenario-dependent effects\nthat motivate the paper’s deployment recommendations.\nModel-level SVI distribution.\nAs shown in Figure 7, model-level SVI values form a visibly bimodal\nstructure: OSS models cluster at higher fragility while commercial models concentrate at lower fragility. This\nview complements the lollipop ranking in the main paper by emphasizing density and overlap.\nReasoning elicitation: relative effects.\nFigure 8 reports the percentage change in SVI under reasoning\nelicitation (paired where available). While the main paper emphasizes absolute reductions, this relative view\nhighlights that improvements are not uniform and can include degradations in specific slices, motivating\nconfiguration-specific validation.\nCross-origin justification divergence.\nAs shown in Figure 9, U.S. and Chinese commercial models can\nexhibit different justification patterns by scenario even when their aggregate SVI is similar. We include\nthis plot to document that robustness (consistency) and normative reasoning patterns (justifications) are\nseparable axes.\nScaling analysis (tier vs. fragility).\nFigure 10 visualizes the relationship between model tier and mean\nSVI. The absence of a strong monotonic trend is consistent with the main paper’s claim that robustness is\nnot explained by parameter count alone and may depend more on post-training and alignment investment.\nOSS compliance–fragility relationship.\nAs shown in Figure 11, OSS compliance (structured-output\nsuccess) and fragility are not perfectly coupled. The non-monotonic pattern suggests that higher compliance\ndoes not necessarily imply higher robustness, underscoring why the paper treats compliance filtering as a\nprerequisite rather than a robustness proxy.\nScenario robustness profiles by origin.\nFigure 12 summarizes scenario-level SVI profiles for each origin\ncategory. The OSS polygon generally encloses commercial polygons, consistent with elevated fragility across\nscenarios; scenario-by-scenario structure (e.g., comparatively lower medical fragility) remains visible across\norigins.\nScenario robustness profiles by model tier.\nAs shown in Figure 13, tier-dependent differences are\npresent but not uniform across scenarios. This visualization supports the interpretation that scale effects\ninteract with content scenario, reinforcing the need for scenario-aware robustness reporting.\nScenario robustness profiles under reasoning.\nFigure 14 compares scenario-level SVI under reasoning-\nenabled versus non-reasoning settings (paired where available). In most scenarios the reasoning profile is\nshifted inward (lower SVI), but exceptions motivate the paper’s recommendation to validate reasoning as a\ndeployment configuration rather than assume monotonic benefit.\nInter-model agreement by framing.\nAs shown in Figure 15, models agree most on the positive “should\nX” framing (F0) and least on the negated “should NOT X” framing (F1). This provides an orthogonal\ncorroboration of the negation sensitivity finding: negated frames not only change endorsement rates but also\nreduce consensus across model families.\nPreprint.\n19\n"}, {"page": 20, "text": "0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSyntactic Variation Index (SVI)\ngemini-3-flash-preview\nqwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507\nglm-4p7\ngpt-5.1\ngrok-4-1-fast-reasoning\ndeepseek-v3p2\nkimi-k2-thinking\ngpt-5-mini\nkimi-k2-instruct-0905\ngpt-5.2\nglm-4p6\nminimax-m2\nclaude-sonnet-4-5\ngrok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning\nqwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct\ngranite4:3b\ngemma3n:e4b\nclaude-haiku-4-5\nllama3.2:3b\ngranite3.3:2b\nqwen3:8b-q4_K_M\nministral-3:3b\nministral-3:8b\ngemma3:4b\nphi4-mini:3.8b\nllama3.2:1b\nolmo-3:7b-instruct\nrnj-1:8b\nROBUST\nMODERATE\nFRAGILE\nGlobal SVI Distribution: Per-Scenario Beeswarm by Domain\n(Each dot = one scenario, color = ethical domain, | = mean)\nFinancial\nMedical\nEducation\nBusiness\nScience\nWar\nLaw\nUS (background)\nCN (background)\nOSS (background)\nMean SVI\nUS\nCN\nCN\nUS\nUS\nCN\nCN\nUS\nCN\nUS\nCN\nCN\nUS\nUS\nCN\nOSS\nOSS\nUS\nOSS\nOSS\nCN\nUS\nOSS\nOSS\nOSS\nOSS\nOSS\nOSS\nFigure 7: Distribution of model fragility (SVI) by origin.

We\ndistinguish between implicit ablations already embedded in the main experimental design and an explicit\ntemperature ablation conducted to assess the role of stochastic decoding.\nE.1\nImplicit Ablations in the Main Experimental Design\nAlthough the main paper emphasizes methodological simplicity, the evaluation protocol already contains\nseveral controlled ablations that isolate potential confounds:\nFraming ablation.\nEach scenario is evaluated under four logically equivalent syntactic frames (F0–F3)\ndiffering only in polarity and conditional structure. This directly ablates syntactic form while holding scenario\ncontent fixed via Logical Polarity Normalization (LPN).\nScenario ablation.\nWe evaluate 14 scenarios spanning multiple ethical categories. This implicitly ablates\nethical content and reveals scenario-structured heterogeneity in fragility (Section 4.4), demonstrating that\nSFF is not driven by a narrow subset of prompts.\nModel-origin ablation.\nComparisons across U.S. commercial, Chinese commercial, and open-source\nmodels isolate the effect of training and alignment regime while holding the evaluation protocol constant.\nReasoning-mode ablation.\nFor model families offering both reasoning-enabled and non-reasoning variants,\nwe treat these as distinct systems. This ablates deliberative prompting while holding provider and architecture\nfixed, enabling within-family robustness comparisons.\nRepeated-sampling ablation.\nAt the default temperature (T = 0.7), each (model, scenario, frame)\ncell is sampled repeatedly. This separates distributional instability from single-sample noise and supports\nnonparametric hypothesis testing (Cochran’s Q with FDR correction).\nTogether, these dimensions already constitute a multi-factor ablation design, even though they are presented\ncompactly in the main body.\nE.2\nTemperature Ablation: Is Fragility a Sampling Artifact?\nA common concern in prompt-sensitivity analyses is that apparent instability may be driven by stochastic\ndecoding rather than by the underlying decision structure. We therefore conduct a targeted temperature\nablation comparing deterministic and stochastic decoding.\nHypothesis.\nIf SFF primarily reflects sampling noise, then reducing temperature to zero (T = 0.0) should\nsubstantially reduce the Syntactic Variation Index (SVI). Conversely, persistence of SFF under deterministic\ndecoding would indicate a structural robustness failure.\nExperimental design.\nWe evaluate a subset of representative models spanning the observed SVI range\n(high, medium, low fragility) on five scenarios selected to cover both high- and low-fragility regimes. All\nscenarios are evaluated under the same four syntactic frames (F0–F3).\n• Models: phi4-mini:3.8b (OSS), claude-sonnet-4-5 (US commercial), qwen3:8b-q4 K M (OSS)\n• Scenarios: business 2, war 1, medical 1, education 2, science 2\n• Conditions: (1) T = 0.7 (stochastic baseline; 30 samples per cell), (2) T = 0.0 (deterministic decoding;\nsingle sample per cell)\nWe verified strict determinism at T = 0.0 (identical outputs across repeated calls) for all included models.\nPreprint.\n28\n"}, {"page": 29, "text": "Results.\nReducing temperature does not attenuate syntactic fragility. Instead, mean SVI increases under\ndeterministic decoding:\n• Mean SVI at T = 0.7: 0.67\n• Mean SVI at T = 0.0: 0.80\n• Relative change: +16%\nAt the model level, two of three models exhibit higher SVI at T = 0.0, while one shows a modest decrease.\nA Wilcoxon signed-rank test finds no statistically significant difference between conditions (p = 0.875),\nindicating that temperature does not systematically reduce fragility.\nInterpretation.\nThese results suggest that stochasticity partially masks syntactic fragility rather than\ncausing it. Deterministic decoding exposes sharper discontinuities across logically equivalent frames, consistent\nwith a brittle internal decision boundary. Consequently, the default T = 0.7 results in the main paper should\nbe interpreted as a lower bound on true syntactic fragility.\nE.3\nSummary of Ablation Evidence\nAcross both implicit and explicit ablations, SFF remains: (1) invariant to decoding temperature, (2) consistent\nacross scenario subsets, (3) conditionally mitigated but not eliminated by reasoning, and (4) strongly amplified\nby syntactic negation.
