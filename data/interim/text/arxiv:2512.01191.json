OpenEvidence, claimed to be used by 40% of U.S. physicians3 and to ace the \nUSMLE4, has only been evaluated either internally4 or qualitatively5. Similarly, the newly \nreleased UpToDate Expert AI, already used by clinicians at an estimated 70% of major enterprise \nhealth systems6, still awaits any sort of independent quantitative evaluation. There is a substantial \ngap between marketing claims and rigorous, peer-reviewed assessment of clinical AI \nperformance. This has created a situation in which individual clinicians and health systems may \nadopt AI systems without adequate evidence regarding their limitations, biases, comparative \nperformance, or failure modes. In settings where AI outputs influences diagnosis or management \ndecisions, this lack of transparency may introduce avoidable clinical risk and challenges \nevidence-based integration of AI into care. \n \nIt is commonly hypothesized that specialist tools may be superior to generalist LLMs through \ndomain-specific training7–9 or retrieval augmented generation (RAG)3,6,7. However, specialist \nsystems vary in their design, scope, and implementation. Frontier generalist models benefit from \nsubstantially larger training corpora and more advanced alignment, which may enable them to \nmatch or exceed specialist performance depending on the task. Independent evaluations capable \nof comparing these two categories of models on standardized, clinically relevant benchmarks are \ncritical to clarify whether specialization offers measurable advantage. To address this gap, we \nconducted the first quantitative assessment of specialized clinical AI tools (OpenEvidence, \nUpToDate Expert AI) and leading generalist models (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro Preview, and Claude \n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "5 \nSonnet 4.5) on a mini-benchmark comprising knowledge-intensive (MedQA1) and \nexpert-alignment (HealthBench2) tasks. \n \n \nMethods \nWe created a medical mini-benchmark by randomly sampling 500 USMLE-style questions from \nMedQA1 to assess factual knowledge, and 500 prompts from HealthBench2 to evaluate alignment \nwith expert judgement. The resulting 1,000 questions were used to assess GPT-5 (snapshot \ngpt-5-2025-08-07), Gemini 3 Pro Preview (accessed 11/20/25), and Sonnet 4.5 (snapshot \nclaude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) via their respective APIs, while OpenEvidence (accessed 09/25)  \nand UpToDate Expert AI (accessed 11/25) were manually queried via a browser interface. \nOpenEvidence and UpToDate were grouped as clinical tools, whereas the other three (GPT-5, \nGemini 3 Pro, and Sonnet 4.5) were considered to be generalist models. \n \nHealthBench responses were graded for the proportion of rubric points achieved across five axes: \naccuracy, completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and instruction following. \nHealthBench questions were restricted to prompts requiring a single, standalone response (i.e., \nno multi-turn interactions). Responses were also subset into seven themes: emergency referrals, \ncontext seeking, global health, health data tasks, expertise-tailored communication, responding \nunder uncertainty, and response depth. \n \n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "6 \nScoring for HealthBench and MedQA were completed by GPT-4.1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) which \ndemonstrated reliability in grading medical Q&A2.

Notably, \nOpenEvidence fell short of its reported 100% accuracy on USMLE-style questions4. Our results \nreveal a consistent pattern in which clinical AI tools lag behind frontier generalist models on \nnumerous dimensions of clinical importance, such as completeness, communication quality, and \ncontext awareness. Without knowing the underlying architecture of these systems, it is hard to \nknow why they may underperform generalist models. However research has shown that RAG, \nwhich both OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI heavily rely on, can hurt model \nperformance if the wrong material is retrieved or if it is poorly integrated by the base model.7,10,11 \nAnother possibility is simply the strength of frontier LLMs, which excel at the knowledge \nretrieval and reasoning tasks that characterize many medical questions. \nThese findings have broader implications for the evolving landscape of clinical AI. As generative \nmodels become integrated into routine decision-making, discrepancies between advertised claims \nand real-world performance introduce avoidable clinical risk.

Importantly, much of today’s AI use is emerging bottom-up, as clinicians and patients \nexperiment with these models on their personal devices well before formal institutional adoption. \nThe consistently superior performance of generalist models suggests that scale, alignment, and \ncross-domain reasoning may outweigh domain-specific tuning as determinants of medical \ncompetency. If this trend continues, the perceived distinction between “clinical LLMs” and \n“general-purpose LLMs” may become increasingly artificial, with implications for procurement, \nreimbursement, and regulatory oversight. \nThis study has several limitations. We were constrained to modest sample sizes due to the need \nfor manual evaluation of OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI. Moreover, standardized \nbenchmarks, while allowing quantitative comparison, have inherent shortcomings.10 It is possible \nthat recently trained models or tools have been trained on the benchmarks themselves, which \nwere incidentally swept up in their training data. Such concerns underscore the need for open \ndatasets, open weights, and greater transparency surrounding AI systems utilized within clinical \nmedicine. Nonetheless, controlled studies and independent benchmarks of AI systems in \nmedicine are essential to ensure the safe clinical use of these technologies. Perhaps most \nimportantly, however, is the pressing need for actual clinical trials looking at the impact of these \ntechnologies with patient centered outcomes as their endpoints. Future work should examine \nperformance across broader datasets, contexts, and safety-critical outcomes and the need for \nregulatory guidance regarding the evaluation of all LLMs in healthcare.\n \n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "12 \nAcknowledgements: We would like to acknowledge Nader Mherabi and Dafna Bar-Sagi, Ph.D., \nfor their continued support of medical AI research at NYU.
