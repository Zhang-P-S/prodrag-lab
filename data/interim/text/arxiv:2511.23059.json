A defining feature of\nancient medical thinking is its reliance on imagistic cognition, where dense\nmetaphorical and metonymic expressions function as cognitive cues for clinical\nreasoning (Jia et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2022; Han et al., 2024). The culturally\nembedded and largely implicit logic of these texts, however, is difficult to discern and\narticulate, making it challenging for target-language readers to fully comprehend and\napply TCM principles in clinical practice.\nAs classical medical texts seldom make their metaphorical and metonymic\nmappings explicit—and instead rely on them as a cognitive background—translators\nmust identify these mappings and restore their narrative functions in translation. Only\nthen can target-language readers grasp the underlying medical reasoning and experience\nthe “imagistic thinking” that structures TCM. The translation therefore needs to move\nbeyond semantic fidelity. It must attend to the metaphorical grounding of medical\nconcepts (Lakoff & Johnson, 2011) and the metonymic patterns that organise relations\namong events and phenomena (Kövecses & Radden, 1998). In other words, the task is\nnot simply linguistic but cognitive: not merely the rendering of terms, but the\nreconstruction of the conceptual schemas through which ancient physicians understood\nthe body and its processes (Johnson, 1987; 2007).\nMost existing translations rely on literal rendering. Although concise and fluent,\nsuch translations often compromise clarity (Chen et al., 2025). Classical Chinese\noperates without explicit connective markers, and its clinical logic depends heavily on\nmetaphor–metonymy relations that function as cognitive linkages rather than surface\nlinguistic structures. Target-language readers, however, generally lack the conceptual\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "foundations embedded in ancient medical practices and philosophical systems (e.g., the\nFive Phases, yunqi cosmology). Without sufficient explanation, literal translations\nobscure the reasoning structure of the text. By contrast, LLM-generated translations\ntend to be more explanatory and reader-oriented, thereby reducing cognitive load. Yet\nthey still fall short in detecting and reconstructing metaphor and metonymy, making\nthem inadequate for supporting deeper cognitive needs—understanding, transferring,\nand applying TCM principles.\nExisting research in translation evaluation has largely centered on terminological\naccuracy, comparative analyses of prior translation strategies, and the performance of\nLLMs（Wang & Chen, 2023), whereas far less attention has been directed toward\nreaders’ cognitive pathways and cognitive needs—an area that remains insufficiently\nexplored but is crucial for understanding how translations function in practice. As TCM\nclassics are fundamentally medical texts rather than cultural artifacts, their primary\npurpose is to guide clinical reasoning and inform therapeutic decision-making. The\ndissemination of medical principles therefore requires not only terminological precision\nbut also translation that enables readers to reconstruct diagnostic logic and to develop\nconfidence in applying it in clinical settings. Accordingly, translation quality should be\nassessed not merely in linguistic terms, but also in terms of its pragmatic efficiency and\ncognitive depth (House, 2015; Xiao & Muñoz Martín, 2021), particularly regarding how\nwell it assists readers in navigating and internalizing the conceptual structure of TCM.\nAgainst this background, this study examines Huangdi Neijing—the most\nfrequently translated TCM classic—and proposes a human–machine collaborative\napproach to improving the translation of metaphor- and metonymy-laden passages.\nUsing prompts as cognitive scaffolding, TCM experts supply the background\nknowledge needed to steer the LLM toward identifying relevant metaphor–metonymy\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "cues and adjusting its renderings accordingly. The LLM, in turn, internalizes the\nprompted reasoning patterns and incorporates them into its translation output. Four\npassages from the Huangdi Neijing—dense in metaphor and metonymy, difficult to\ninterpret, and central to theoretical guidance—were selected for this translation\nexperiment. For evaluation, a mixed-method design was adopted, in which LLMs\nfunctioned as computationally simulated readers that compared human, baseline, and\nprompt-adjusted translations from pragmatic and cognitive perspectives, providing\nexplicit reasoning to reveal their reception pathways. The design is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the study design.\n(Note: Each case has four versions. Red: prompt-adjusted translation; blue: baseline translation;\npurple: two human translations.)\nThis study addresses the following research questions: (1) How can translations\nenhance cognitive transferability, enabling readers to accurately understand and apply\nTCM principles? (2) What are the cognitive needs of different types of readers, and\nwhere do they encounter obstacles in comprehending and applying existing translations?\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "(3) Which translation strategies for TCM classics enhance cognitive efficiency, and how\ncan LLMs be leveraged to support these strategies?\nThe contribution of this study is treating LLMs not merely as translation tools\nbut as adaptive systems capable of rhetoric learning（Shao et al., 2024; Tang et al.,\n2025）. Through prompt engineering, the cognitive patterns embedded in TCM are\ntransferred to the model, resulting in comprehensive improvements in translation quality.\nThe findings highlight the explanatory power of metaphor and metonymy as cognitive\ncues in TCM reasoning and their critical role in facilitating cognitive transfer during\ntranslation. By providing a reproducible and efficient framework, this study advances\nthe cross-cultural communication of TCM theory, extends theoretical understanding of\nAI-assisted translation within translation studies, and offers guidance for translating\nhistorically and conceptually complex texts. The following sections review relevant\nliterature, research design, quantitative and qualitative results, and the theoretical and\npractical implications of this approach.\nLiterature review\n2.1 Translation of TCM Classics and Its Challenges\nClassical TCM texts contain complex conceptual systems and characteristic modes of\nthought. Their translation is highly valuable yet extremely challenging, functioning as a\nrepresentative case of texts that are simultaneously theoretical, historical, and cultural.\nSince the 1990s, translation efforts for TCM theories have gradually expanded, largely\nfocusing on the standardization of terminology and the translation of classical texts,\nwith English translations dominating the field.\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "Terminology studies have progressed more rapidly than classical texts for the\ngrowing clinical needs (Lim et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2024). Currently, the two best\nknown versions are the WHO International Standard Terminologies on Traditional\nChinese Medicine (WHO, 2022) and the International Standard Chinese-English Basic\nNomenclature of Chinese Medicine issued by the World Federation of Chinese\nMedicine Societies (Li, 2008). The standards formed the basis of clinical guidelines,\ndiagnostic protocols, and international medical collaboration.\nIn contrast, the translation of classical TCM texts is more individualized and\ninfluenced by the translator’s expertise and style. Since high-quality translations of\ncanonical texts are few, the scale of translation research is limited, and the translation\ntheories adopted are scattered and lack a unified paradigm. Among classical texts,\nHuangdi Neijing has received most attention, the two most academically influential\ntranslations are those by Li Zhaoguo and Paul U. Unschuld. Li, as a native-language\ntranslator, prioritizes fidelity to the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of the original,\nwhereas Unschuld—working from German, a West Germanic language closely aligned\nwith English—can be regarded as a target-language–oriented translator whose\nrenderings display poetic expressiveness and a natural idiomatic flow.\nBecause of its cultural complexity, the translation of TCM texts faces a dilemma\nbetween overt and covert strategies. For example, Lim et al. argue that while literal\ntranslation preserves terminological integrity and free translation enhances clarity, the\ntwo aims can hardly coexist, so a context-dependent strategy might help (Lim et al.,\n2022). Chen et al. report, through student evaluations, that domestication in translation\nleads to easier but compromised understanding of terms (Chen et al., 2025). Translators\nof Huangdi Neijing note that, due to the cultural and historical gap between the source\nand target text, the greatest challenge is conveying cultural concepts and transferring\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "cognitive modes. Therefore, a shared strategy is to supplement the text with extensive\ncommentaries from later physicians, which assumes that it is the reader’s responsibility\nto learn, discern and differentiate the theoretical information in the annotations (Li,\n2008; Unschuld, 2016). This is unrealistic for target readers who lack TCM background\nand historical knowledge, and likely to make the reading burdened and confusing.\nWhat is worth noting is that the above studies demonstrate a reader-oriented\nperspective, examining whether the translation helps readers understand and apply TCM\ntheory. This represents a valuable pragmatic turn given the clinical importance of TCM\ntreatises. As House emphasizes in her pragmatics-oriented translation evaluation\nframework, translation constitutes a cognitively grounded transfer that occurs both in\nthe translator’s mind and in cross-linguistic and cross-cultural social practice:\n“Translation is both a cognitive procedure which occurs in a human being’s, the\ntranslator’s, head, and a social, cross-linguistic and cross-cultural practice. Any valid\ntheory of translation must embrace these two aspects.” (House, 2015, p. 1). Thus, the\ncore task of TCM translation is to convey the underlying cognitive patterns of TCM.\n2.2 Cognitive Features of TCM Language\nSince around 2010, researchers have noted the compatibility between cognitive\nlinguistics and TCM thought (Jia, 2012). The cognitive model of TCM is derived from\nsensory and practical experience and is highly imagistic, reflected linguistically through\nextensive use of metaphor and metonymy—metaphor for explanation and metonymy\nfor connection. Semantics is essentially the expression of imagistic thinking, in which\nimage schemas grounded in embodied experience are constructed and abstracted (Shi &\nYue, 2024; Liu et al., 2025), serving as source domains for metaphors that interpret and\ncategorize medical concepts (Lakoff & Johnson, 2011). These schemas are drawn not\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "only from basic spatial and temporal perception (Zhong & Liu, 2022) but also from\nmeteorology, agriculture, astronomy, geography, warfare, and governance, explaining\nphysiological and pathological mechanisms in a dynamic, philosophical, and holistic\nway (Jia, 2014).\nOnce metaphors become conventionalized as theoretical categories, metonymy\nbecomes an additional powerful tool. Metonymic relations are organized around the\nessential features of categories and events, and they build cross-ontological and cross-\ndomain connections according to context (Kövecses & Radden, 1998). TCM learners\nfirst acquire a concrete understanding of medical categories through metaphor; later, in\nclinical discourse and practice, they employ metonymic reference to connect categories\nand events, forming a coherent theoretical understanding that guides clinical reasoning\n(Han et al., 2024).\nThese cognitive structures become transferable once metaphor and metonymy—\nas their linguistic representations—are identified and interpreted. This is supported by\ncognitive linguistics and cognitive psychology, which emphasize that humans form\nimage schemas and idealized cognitive models as reference structures for organizing\nexperience and adapting to the environment, corresponding to neural connectivity\npatterns (Johnson, 1987; Kövecses & Radden, 1998; Lakoff & Johnson, 2011). As these\ncognitive structures are highly flexible and well adapted to the environment, they can be\nunderstood across cultures through shared embodied experience (Johnson, 2007; Zhou\n& Wang, 2025). In effective translation, such metaphor adaptation and semantic frame\nshifting help overcome cultural and idiomatic barriers (Ali & Jameel, 2025). Therefore,\nthe cross-cultural challenge of TCM translation is to convey the schemas rather than the\nsurface text. Recent studies highlight the role of metaphor and metonymy in enabling\nembodied cognition transfer and cultural re-enactment in translation (Zhou & Wang,\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "2025; Jiang et al., 2022). However, research on metonymy remains far less developed\nthan research on metaphor. Given the historical and cultural distance, conveying\nmetaphors is difficult in practice, and their translatability is limited (Hong & Rossi,\n2021; Kuang & Tang, 2025). The solution is to incorporate metonymy: once metaphors\n“die” and become conceptual systems—such as the Five Phases framework in TCM—\ntheir imagistic features evolve into the basis for referential relations in metonymy\n(Kövecses & Radden, 1998), which constitutes the logic used in clinical practice.\nAccordingly, this study employs both metaphor and metonymy as fundamental elements\nfor adjusting LLM translations to optimize them at the cognitive level.\n2.3 Optimization of LLM Translation\nLLMs function primarily as tools or assistants in translation. Trained on massive\ncorpora, they possess strong linguistic capabilities, produce translations, and enhance\ntranslators’ proficiency in the target language. However, their cultural sensitivity,\nprofessional knowledge, and contextual awareness are still limited compared with those\nof human translators (Shahmerdanova, 2025), and translation quality is affected by\ndisparities in target-language resource availability. Jabak identifies two primary areas\nwhere LLMs support human translators: AI-Augmented Decision Making (AADM) and\nEthical & Bias Mitigation Layer (EBML), with high-quality output depending on\nhuman feedback grounded in context, culture, and domain expertise (Adaptive\nFeedback Loop, AFL) (Jabak, 2025; Jiao et al., 2023).\nThe optimization of LLM translation usually proceeds in the following aspects.\nLow-resource and exploratory studies typically rely on prompt-based methods to probe\nmodel capabilities and transferability, whereas mature and well-structured datasets\nemploy fine-tuning for stable performance improvement.\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "Domain adaptation and application. This is common in medical translation, such\nas zero-shot prompt-based tuning to improve readability in health communication\n(Githinji et al., 2025) or enhance terminological accuracy (Rios, 2025).\nCultural and contextual supplementation. Supplementing background knowledge\nis essential in this context. For example, Ranade et al. demonstrate that prompts\nencoding rhetorical and contextual information improve model comprehension and user\ninteraction, with applicability to pedagogical contexts (Ranade et al., 2025). N-shot\nprompt injection allows models to quickly learn contextual roles and discourse styles,\nproducing human-like translations (Pourkamali & Sharifi, 2025).\nMetaphor learning and cognitive scaffolding. LLMs lack robust capability to\nrecognize metaphor, especially when the role of metaphor is not rhetorical but\nconceptual (Guo, 2023). For this, Shao et al. incorporated metaphorical interpretations\ninto fine-tuning datasets as chain-of-thought (CoT) modules, which significantly\nenhanced the translation quality (Shao et al., 2024). In TCM, Tang et al. analyzed\nmetaphors in perceptual dimensions (familiarity, emotional arousal, semantic accuracy) ,\nwhich served as an effective reasoning scaffold for LLMs—improving DeepSeek V3\naccuracy by over 20%. They suggest domain-tailored parsing to enhance domain\nadaptation (Tang et al., 2025).\nAs seen in the above approaches, human-in-the-loop (HITL) is an effective\nmethodology in enhancing LLM translation, which could either be AI-led with human\nsupervision (HITL) or human-led with AI assisting with repetitive tasks (AITL)\n(Natarajan et al., 2025). Both modes consider humans and LLMs as co-translators: the\nformer for cultural and domain understanding, the latter for readable expressions and\nlarge volumes of work (Lianeri & Zajko, 2008; Vassallo, 2015; Latif & Arshad, 2025).\nThis suggests LLMs and humans are both interpretive mediators, which takes the\n"}, {"page": 11, "text": "knowledge and feedback from human expertise as high-quality contextual databases for\nlow-resource texts (Yang et al., 2023). Such reader-oriented translation corresponds\nwith cognitive translation theory that is integrating with psychological methods (Xiao &\nMuñoz Martín, 2021).\n2.4 Evaluation of LLM Translation\nAs LLM-based translation and its optimization increasingly focus on cognitive\ntransferability and contextual interpretability, evaluation frameworks have likewise\nbecome more effective and practical. Current studies combine automatic and human-\nbased approaches and introduce human-like, novel automatic evaluation models.\nIn existing research, automatic evaluation metrics rely on reference translations\nand remain less sensitive to context and culture. BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), based on\nlexical similarity, offers limited value. Neural evaluation models assess semantic\nconsistency more robustly (Freitag et al., 2022). For example, COMET and BERTScore\nmeasure semantic similarity (Rei et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), and BartScore\nevaluates generated text quality (Yuan et al., 2021). All of these require high-quality\nreference translations (Qian et al., 2024). Meanwhile, human evaluation remains largely\nexperiential, focusing primarily on comparing translation strategies in existing\nrenditions (Lim et al., 2022).\nThese metrics are insufficient for TCM translations. TCM classics are extremely\nlow-resource and zero-reference texts, and their translations are cognitively open,\nrequiring flexible evaluation. For such low-resource scenarios without reference\ntranslations, models such as GEMBA employ multi-round back-translation to compare\nsource–target similarity, reducing dependence on references (Kocmi & Federmann,\n2023). Document-level and long-context evaluation methods have also been shown to\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "approximate human assessment more closely (Haq et al., 2025). For culturally or\ncontextually sensitive assessments, expert contextual intervention remains essential\n(Huang et al., 2024). Qualitative methods and context-sensitive frameworks such as\nHouse’s model (House, 2015) highlight differences in cultural interpretation and\ncognitive load, offering deep insights into the explanatory function of translation (Chen\net al., 2023; Metwally et al., 2025; Mohammed, 2025) and guiding the formulation of\ncontext-appropriate strategies (Calvo & De La Cova, 2023).\nAlthough more thorough and instructive, qualitative and context-sensitive\nevaluation typically involves small samples and limited generalizability. However,\nLLM-as-a-judge, as a novel evaluation design, may overcome these limitations (Yuksel\net al., 2025; Baysan et al., 2025). With context-adjusted prompts, LLMs can act as\nevaluators to rate comprehensibility, consistency, and pragmatic adequacy, though their\nperformance remains sensitive to prompt design and model type (Qian et al., 2024;\nBavaresco et al., 2025). For literary and culturally dense texts, LLMs show potential in\ncapturing imagery, metaphor, and cultural meaning, yet they also suffer from\ninterpretive biases and limitations in stylistic reproduction (Zhang et al., 2025). This\nstudy develops a role-conditioned and cross-validated LLM reader model, offering a\nmore interpretable and cognitively aligned evaluation pathway than existing prompt-\nbased assessment approaches.\n3 Methods\nThis study uses prompts as a cognitive scaffold. The metaphoric and metonymic cues in\nTCM texts were revealed as a supplement, encoded into prompts for a large language\nmodel (LLM) to support the model’s comprehension of diagnostic-therapeutic logic.\nAdjusting the model’s reasoning patterns step by step, the LLM was guided to improve\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "translations.

These passages are central to foundational TCM theory,\ncomplicated in interpretation, and notably difficult for English readers when rendered\nby literal translation. Each case is rich in metaphor and metonymy that are originated\nfrom the human–nature relationship, and form the basis of physiology, pathogenesis,\nand therapeutic principles in the narrative. However, the metaphoric projections and\nreferential relations are not explicitly presented in the contexts and thus require\nsupplementation by the translator. Through prompts these cues were supplemented to\nguide the model to draw the cognitive map and polish the translation. The cases are\nlabeled Case 1 through Case 4. Case 1 focuses on conveying the metaphorical content\nembedded in terminology; Cases 2 and 3 address failures to reflect the projection and\nreference in the source texts; Case 4 additionally involves discussion of therapeutic\nprinciples and methods, requiring both metaphor–metonymy clarification and explicit\nexplanation of treatment rationale.\n3.2 Choice of LLMs\nAs LLMs differ in style, preferences, and translation capability, a single LLM was\nadopted as the primary translation engine to ensure consistency, while employing\nmultiple LLMs in the evaluation stage to assess cross-model agreement.\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "Deepseek V3.1 was used for cognitive prompt tuning.

An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) yielded\nthree overarching themes, which further validate the prompting framework and allow\ncomparison of translational strategies between human and LLM translations.\nTheme 1: Features of human vs. LLM translations\nReaders generally found LLM translations more straightforward, whereas human\ntranslations imposed higher cognitive load. Literal translation was the key differentiator:\nhuman translators frequently rendered the text literally, producing concise and\n"}, {"page": 24, "text": "structurally faithful sentences, but readers reported that such versions conveyed\ndefinitional knowledge rather than clinical reasoning, making application difficult.\nTheme 2: Development of translation strategies\nDuring prompt adjustment, supplementing historical and textual context helped\nreconstruct metaphorical imagery and metonymic referents and integrate them into\ndiagnostic logic. Readers reported improved confidence in understanding and applying\nthe concepts. Furthermore, maintaining textual fluency and inserting\nmetaphor/metonymy through natural syntactic choices (e.g., dynamic verbs) reduced\ncognitive load and made the translations more vivid. However, providing extensive\nmetaphorical background knowledge introduced cognitive burden and did not aid\ncomprehension, suggesting limited usefulness of this strategy.\nTheme 3: Reader-specific cognitive features and evaluation orientations\nThe three roles differ in educational background and interpretive orientation. These\ndifferences across roles are summarized in Table 6.\nCognitive load is the major point of divergence in their evaluations. Role 2, with\nonly TCM-based training, perceives dense terminology not as unfamiliar concepts but\nas a rigorous anchor for comprehension, producing evaluations opposite to those of the\nother two roles.\nTable 6.

It thus constitutes a viable and effective translation practice.\n5. Discussion\n5.1 Overview of major findings\nThe simulated-reader evaluations show that cognitively informed prompt adjustments—\nparticularly those that supplement metaphorical and metonymic cues—help reconstruct\nthe text’s original mode of reasoning and its imagistic explanation of medical principles\nin the Huangdi Neijing. By aligning the translation process with the narrative logic of\n“imagistic thinking” (象思维), the adjusted translations demonstrate consistent\nimprovements across five cognitive–pragmatic dimensions—Clarity, Cognitive Load,\nConfidence in Understanding, Preference, and Clinical Transferability. Readers reported\nhigher levels of comprehension, willingness to apply, and confidence in applying the\ntranslated content; their paraphrases of the medical rationale became more accurate,\nmore coherent with classical TCM reasoning, and more conducive to integrating TCM\ninsights into Western clinical thought.\nAmong the adjustment strategies, two were particularly well received: (1) mapping\nmetaphorical meanings into verbal expressions to portray physiological and\npathological dynamics vividly; and (2) refraining from directly adding the entire\n"}, {"page": 26, "text": "metaphorical or metonymic schema, instead guiding the model to analyse their\nexplanatory function and transfer this function into diagnostic–therapeutic logic. These\nstrategies allow the translation to balance fidelity to the source texts with clarity and\nconceptual concreteness in explicating medical principles.\n5.2 Cognitive mechanisms underlying prompt engineering\nThis study treats prompts as a cognitive scaffold that guides the LLM to reason about\nmetaphor and metonymy through the Neijing’s explanatory mode—its cosmological\nview of the human–nature relationship—and to transfer this reasoning appropriately\ninto translation. Concretely, the prompts first examine the LLM’s baseline and its\ninferential process, prompting it to explain the cognitive basis of its initial translation.\nThis reveals the model’s grasp of imagistic sources, metonymic relations, and textual\nfeatures. Based on these observations, the researcher diagnoses whether deficiencies in\nthe LLM’s output stem from background-knowledge gaps, incomplete theoretical\nreasoning, or purely linguistic issues, and then revises the prompts accordingly.\nFor example, in Case 1 the LLM recognised the metaphoric origin of “xu xie”\n(虚邪) but failed to interpret and convey its theoretical meaning. The problem therefore\nlay in conceptual transfer rather than metaphor recognition, which informed subsequent\nprompt adjustments.\nThree major cognitive pathways of prompt optimization emerged:\n(1) Supplementing knowledge.\nPrompts add contextual knowledge from other chapters of Huangdi Neijing and\nliterature of the same era that describes the astronomical and agricultural practice,\nallowing the LLM to reconstruct the embodied cognition and historical worldview that\nshaped metaphor and metonymy. This enables identification of metaphoric projections\n"}, {"page": 27, "text": "and metonymic referents and supports an understanding of how these rhetorical devices\nground physiological and pathological explanations. For example, prompts in Case4\nencouraged the LLM to interpret the passage through the lens of five motion and six qi\n(wuyun liuqi, 五运六气) theory, then guided it heuristically to infer the metonymic\nrelationship between xuan (玄), the colour black, and annual water qi motion, supported\nby excerpts from Huangdi Neijing such as “司气为玄化” and “司气者主岁同”.\n(2) Transferring explanation.\nSince the ultimate function of metaphor and metonymy is explanatory rather\nthan decorative, prompts directed the LLM to centre medical rationale in the translation\nand retain the source’s concise style rather than explicate every imagistic link. In Case 4,\nthe prompt “preserve the source structure as much as possible” guided the model to\ntranslate “地玄” directly as the annual water qi motion, avoiding excessive explication\nthat would burden the reader. In Case 3, although the LLM correctly analysed the\nimagery behind root-branch-mediate qi (标本中气), it failed to represent their\nfunctional linkage; the prompt then instructed the model to focus on clinical\nsignificance rather than literal rendering.\n(3) Constructing discourse.\nThis involves refining expression to make the medical logic vivid, coherent, and\nconceptually manageable, without introducing Western biomedical terminology or\nexcessive pinyin (phonetic symbols of Chinese characters). In Case 3, the initial\nadjusted version abandoned the original structure and produced a purely expository\nexplanation. A prompt then required the model to follow the source text structure while\nintegrating the earlier theoretical analysis, resulting in a translation that extends the\n"}, {"page": 28, "text": "source text discursively without becoming a total commentary. In Case 2, literal\nrendering reduced the passage to a mechanical model; prompts encouraged the model to\nexpress the Five Phases’ interactions through dynamic verbs, capturing their generative\nand regulatory functions more effectively.\n5.3 Interpretation of emergent themes from reader feedback\nTranslation strategies requiring refinement\nReaders consistently indicated that direct, literal translation should be avoided in\nTCM classics. Literal renderings obscure the intended medical logic and may mislead\npractitioners, reducing confidence in clinical applicability. For example, in Case 3,\ncomments included:\nR1: “‘Ceasing yin’ (厥阴) is awkward: does yin stop/transform at the midpoint,\nor does yin become quiescent? hard to map onto clinical signs.”\nR2: “Not interpretable for clinical use. Over-literal, impractical. Stiff, confusing\nsyntax.”\nIn contrast, readers preferred plain, familiar English phrasing—even when this\nmeant the baseline translation outperformed the adjusted version in Case 1. Pinyin, the\nphonetic symbols of Chinese characters, should be used only sparingly, ideally with the\nChinese text and a brief definition in parentheses to avoid homophone ambiguity. For\nexample, R2 misinterpreted “sheng (胜)” as “sheng (生)” in Li Zhaoguo’s translation of\nCase 2.\nBackground knowledge supporting metaphor and metonymy should be added\nflexibly. In Case 1, the final translation scored lower because cosmological notions such\nas Taiyi were perceived as culturally distant and cognitively burdensome.\n"}, {"page": 29, "text": "R1 commented: “I must ignore the astronomical detail and focus solely on the\n‘correct vs. opposite’ dichotomy.”\nAlthough the baseline version mishandled terminology, its medical meaning\nwas clear enough for readers to restate accurately and apply clinically. This suggests\nthat terminology itself may not serve as the primary cognitive anchor; rather, it is the\nsurrounding conceptual context that plays this role. Translators should therefore\nprioritise explanatory coherence over exhaustive background supplementation; such\nsupplementation that describes the metaphoric origin could be placed in footnotes rather\nthan integrated into the main text.\nEffective translation strategies\nEmbedding metaphorical meaning into verbs greatly helps readers envision\nphysiological and pathological dynamics and grasp inter-category relationships. In Case\n2, this strategy clarified Five-Phase interactions, prompting R3 to observe:“Although\nthe longest, it is the easiest to process… the translator explicitly links the Phase, the\nSeason, and the mechanism.”\nWhere metaphorical and metonymic cues were fully restored (Cases 3 and 4), all\nreaders reported increased confidence in clinical applicability. R2 noted in Case 3:“I’d\ntrust this version only—it guides diagnostic thinking…the Shaoyang\n(Gallbladder/Sanjiao) expresses Fire, its internal coordination with Jueyin (Liver)\ngoverns the pivot between exterior and interior—key in alternating heat–cold or\nShaoyang disorders.”\nR1 evaluated Case 4 similarly, calling human translations “context-poor” and\nthe baseline AI translation “vague,” whereas the adjusted version was “logically\ncomplete” despite some cognitive load from five motions and six qi (wuyun liuqi,五运\n六气) terminology. For R1, the supplemented metonymic relations—such as the one\n"}, {"page": 30, "text": "between xuan and annual water qi motion—were indispensable for understanding the\nmedical logic.\nCognitive needs of different reader profiles\nReader roles exhibited distinct cognitive orientations:\nR1 (Western clinician with TCM training) emphasised clinical applicability and\nconnections to Western concepts such as endocrine regulation, homeostasis, and\ncircadian rhythms. For Case 2, he likened Five-Phase regulation to counter-regulatory\nhormone dynamics:\n“Regulatory Mechanisms: This strongly aligns with my understanding of metabolic\nregulation and counter-regulatory hormones (e.g., insulin vs. glucagon). It suggests\na system where excesses in one area are managed by the active mechanism of\nanother. It's an analogy for physiological checks and balances.”\nR2 (TCM practitioner) prioritised terminological precision and doctrinal\ncoherence. Standardised TCM terminology reduced cognitive load and activated\nfamiliar theoretical networks, such as his spontaneous association of Case 1 with the\nliuyin (六淫) framework. Standardized TCM terminology prompts associations with\nR2’s prior training in systematic TCM theory, which helps to lower cognitive load：\n“Uses the most standard and recognizable TCM terminology (\"substantial wind,\"\n\"deficient wind\") making the meaning instantly accessible and clinically relevant. Low\ncognitive load.”\nR3 (NHS physician with MSc in TCM) demonstrated an interdisciplinary,\nconceptual approach. In interpreting Case 4, he drew parallels between TCM “fire\nconstraint” and modern models of dysregulated metabolic flow, noting the explanatory\npower of metaphor across medical paradigms：\n"}, {"page": 31, "text": "“Within modern pathological frameworks — such as hypertension, anxiety, and\nmetabolic syndrome — the traditional notion of ‘fire that wishes to descend but is\nconstrained’ can metaphorically represent the coexistence of blocked energy\nmetabolism and emotional stagnation. Thus, it enriches the metaphorical language\nused in clinical interpretation and also suggests that regulation should not be seen\nmerely as inhibition or activation, but rather as the restoration of flow — of\nmovement, circulation, and descent.”\nNotably, all three readers displayed reflective reasoning that moved beyond\nassimilating TCM into Western thought; they actively explored bidirectional conceptual\nintegration. For instance, R1 commented that TCM theory encourages attention to the\n“quality of exposure (It's not just the wind; it's the wind that is 'deficient' or 'contra-\nseasonal')”, a nuance largely absent in Western environmental etiology.\nSuch responses further support the value of cognitively informed prompt\nadjustment: it not only clarifies TCM theory but also cultivates readers’ imagistic\nthinking, enabling deeper cross-system dialogue and more effective clinical practice.\n6. Conclusion\nThis study employed prompt-based guidance to enable LLMs to identify and transfer\nmetaphorical and metonymic cues in classical TCM texts, while using LLM-simulated\nreaders to perform a mixed-methods evaluation across five cognitive dimensions. The\napproach demonstrably enhanced translation quality and offers a novel pathway for both\nthe translation and assessment of TCM classics.\nFrom the perspective of methodological optimization, the iterative prompt\nrefinement process guided the LLM in recognizing metaphorical and metonymic logic\nas well as their narrative functions, transferring these insights into explanatory\ntranslations. This process simulates the construction of meaning in TCM thought\n"}, {"page": 32, "text": "through imagistic schemata, reflecting how physiological and pathological mechanisms\nare interpreted in traditional texts. Unlike standard terminological or knowledge-based\ntranslation approaches, this method seeks cognitively aligned source-target mappings,\nextending the capabilities of vector-based representations to facilitate readers’\nengagement with the distinct features of TCM imagistic thinking. Such alignment can\nsupport clinical practice and substantially improve the translatability of TCM texts.\nAlthough the study is limited to a small number of cases, these segments are highly\ncognitively complex and theoretically representative, suggesting that the method could\nbe scaled to generate fine-tuning datasets, enhance LLM cognitive abilities, and support\nlarge-scale translation of TCM texts. Given that English remains the dominant language\nfor TCM translation, evaluations in this study focused primarily on English (Wang &\nChen, 2023). The source-text-centered optimization method transcends the linguistic\ncharacteristics of the target language, offering a transferable cognitive-tuning paradigm\napplicable to other languages, demonstrating its forward-looking potential.\nRegarding evaluation, LLM-simulated readers proved to be an efficient and\nstable tool.

This method also supports large-scale, longitudinal comparisons of\ntranslations. Notably, the LLM stimulates an idealized reader role (e.g., a hypothetical\nEnglish clinician who has fully mastered TCM theory), and its feedback inevitably\ndiffers from that of human readers. It cannot entirely replace the real-world quantitative\nand qualitative research.

Degree of understanding and points of confusion:\nAfter reading the four translations, which translation gave you a clearer understanding of the\nfollowing concepts:\n• the nature of term 虚邪(contra-seasonal pathogenic qi)/\n• the functional relationships among the five organs across the four seasons/\n• the nature of 标本中气(root/ branch/ mediating qi of the meridians)\n• the patterns of interaction between the qi of Heaven and Earth and the related mechanisms of\ndisease?\nRate each of the four translations (1 2 3 4 5: unclear – somewhat unclear – average – fairly clear –\nvery clear).\nFor each translation, circle all the words or expressions that you find confusing, unnatural, or not\nimmediately understandable. Explain the specific reasons for each point of confusion.\n2. Concept restatement and meaning construction\nUsing your own words, restate the main theoretical ideas presented in each of the four translations.\n"}, {"page": 40, "text": "During this restatement, in what areas did you find yourself “filling in the gaps” or making guesses?\nWhich medical or health-related concepts that you already know did these translations make you\nthink of?\n3.

Confidence in understanding\nOverall, how confident are you in your understanding?\n(1 2 3 4 5: no confidence – low confidence – average – fairly confident – very confident)\nIf you had to make clinical decisions—such as explaining to a patient or forming a treatment plan—\nbased on this understanding, would you feel comfortable?\n5. Translation preference\nPersonally, which translation would you prefer to use when explaining the concepts to your patients\nor colleagues?\nRate each translation (1 2 3 4 5: would never choose – unlikely to choose – neutral – somewhat\nlikely – very likely).\nWhy do you have this preference?\n6. Transferability of theory to clinical practice\nTo what extent, and in what way, would you apply the theories in the translations to real diagnostic\nor therapeutic situations?\nRate each translation (1 2 3 4 5: would not apply at all – unlikely to apply – neutral – likely to apply\n– definitely would apply), and explain how you would apply it.\nDid this text change your understanding of health or disease? If so, how?\n"}]}
