They have been used for assisting clini-\ncal decision support, providing medical education [51], improving\ndiagnostic reasoning, and enhancing patient care [29]. For example,\nthe GPT series has demonstrated the ability to answer medical\nlicensure examinations at or near the passing threshold [26, 31];\nPaLM [13] and its variants achieved encouraging performance on\nspecialty-specific tasks [40]. However, using LLMs in healthcare\ncarries substantial risks due to potential LLM hallucinations [42],\nwhich might be harmless in the general domain but can be danger-\nous in healthcare that requires high precision and rigor [34]. Re-\nsearch has pointed out that LLMs providing incorrect drug dosages\nor misdiagnosing conditions may jeopardize patient safety [25].\nTherefore, rigorous evaluations are necessary before LLM deploy-\nment. Recent surveys of medical LLMs also highlighted mitigating\nhallucinations and establishing domain-specific benchmarks as crit-\nical steps for safety in clinical practice [21, 40, 51].\nAlzheimer’s disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) represent a\ncritical medical domain, with over 57 million people worldwide liv-\ning with ADRD as of 2021 and nearly 10 million new cases diagnosed\neach year [47]. Managing ADRD is not only a medical but also a soci-\netal challenge, as it heavily involves caregiving, long-term support,\nand complex decision-making by families [7]. LLMs are promising\nin serving ADRD care needs due to their capability of communica-\ntion in natural language and cognitive support [43]. For example,\nwith proper design, LLM-driven content may boost patients’ cogni-\ntive abilities and enrich interactions, while offering opportunities\nto improve diagnostic strategies and patient-caregiver communi-\ncation [43]. Like any other medical device, LLMs for ADRD care\nshould be evaluated for technical performance before planning for\nreal-world deployment [46]. However, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere has not been an existing ADRD-specific LLM benchmark for\nthis purpose. Some existing medical benchmarks include ADRD-\nrelated items; however, our investigation showed that these items\nconstitute only a tiny proportion of the total content, mostly under\n1%, indicating that the ADRD domain is largely absent from current\nLLM performance evaluations. In addition, we found that there are\nalmost no caregiving types of testing in existing datasets. While\nLLMs are often targeted to provide support for caregivers, missing\nthe caregiving type leaves a huge gap for real-world applications.\narXiv:2602.11460v1  [cs.CL]  12 Feb 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "To mitigate this gap, we introduce an ADRD-specific bench-\nmark for evaluating LLMs. This benchmark has two parts (ADRD\nUnified QA set and ADRD Caregiving QA set) constructed from\ntwo complementary sources. The ADRD Unified QA set includes\n1,352 ADRD-related items extracted from seven existing bench-\nmark datasets. By aggregating these scattered items into a single\nset, we create a concentrated evaluation of how well current models\nhandle ADRD knowledge that was previously only sparsely repre-\nsented. The ADRD Caregiving QA set includes 149 new questions\nderived from the well-validated Aging Brain Care (ABC) program\nwhich is one of the US’s leading evidence-based dementia care mod-\nels [4, 5, 27]. From de-identified ABC caregiver education materials,\nwe crafted question-answer pairs that reflect realistic caregiving\ncontent, including daily caring situations (e.g., patient aggressive\nbehavior management at home). The design of the questions was\nguided by a senior clinician with national expertise in compre-\nhensive ADRD care to ensure that the questions are grounded in\ndomain expert-verified knowledge and caregiving strategies.\nIn summary, our work presents the first benchmark tailored\nto ADRD tasks. It brings together a wide range of question types\n(e.g., factual Q&A, clinical reasoning, caregiver guidance) under\nthe ADRD umbrella. This resource enables a focused technical as-\nsessment of LLM capabilities in a domain where factual accuracy\nand empathetic reasoning are paramount. We hope that evaluating\nLLMs on ADRD-specific tasks will help identify their current capa-\nbilities and limitations in this domain and drive the development\nof safer, more reliable medical AI for the science of ADRD care.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nCurrent Medical Benchmarks\nThe advent of GPT-3 and successor models spurred extensive re-\nsearch into medical applications of LLMs [51], leading to the de-\nvelopment of many benchmarks to evaluate LLMs’ performance.\nGeneral multitask evaluations such as MMLU assess knowledge\nacross 57 subjects (from math and history to law and medicine),\nproviding a broad measure of academic and professional under-\nstanding [18]. Medical-specific benchmarks have also emerged.\nResearchers used United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)\nquestion banks to assess models, where GPT-3.5/ChatGPT achieved\n~60% accuracy (the passing threshold) without specialized train-\ning [26]. Medical Q&A datasets such as PubMedQA [20], HEAD-\nQA [45], MedQA [19], MedMCQA [35], Medbullets [12] have been\nused to quantify clinical knowledge recall. More recently, Google’s\nMultiMedQA benchmark combined several of these resources, span-\nning professional medical exams, research questions, and consumer\nhealth queries, to holistically evaluate medical LLM knowledge [40].\nOpenAI’s HealthBench [8] focuses on open-ended generation tasks,\nutilizing 48,562 unique rubric criteria to enable more realistic and\ngranular clinical evaluations.\nThese benchmarks have driven rapid progresses; for instance,\nan instruction-tuned PaLM model (Med-PaLM) achieved state-of-\nthe-art (SOTA) performance on multiple-choice questions, reaching\n67.6% accuracy on MedQA [40]. Despite these gains, high scores\non structured, exam-style questions do not necessarily translate\nto real-world clinical competence [23]. Human evaluations reveal\nTable 1: Number of total and ADRD-related questions in\ncommonly used public healthcare benchmarks.\nBenchmark Name\nNumber of\nQuestions\nNumber of ADRD-\nRelated Questions\nNon-Generation Tasks\nMEDCALC-BENCH\n11,000\n112 (1.02%)\nMEDEC\n3,360\n29 (0.86%)\nHEAD-QA\n6,765\n41 (0.61%)\nMedBullets\n616\n12 (1.95%)\nMedQA\n12,723\n98 (0.77%)\nMedMCQA\n193,155\n1,148 (0.59%)\nPubMedQA\n1,000\n12 (1.20%)\nMedHallu\n1,000\n12 (1.20%)\nTotal\n229,619\n1,464 (0.64%)\nGeneration Tasks\nHealthBench\n5,000\n46 (0.92%)\nMedicationQA\n690\n3 (0.43%)\nMedDialog\n181,122\n909 (0.50%)\nMEDIQA\n383\n50 (13.05%)\nTotal\n187,195\n1,008 (0.54%)\npersistent reasoning errors, limited robustness, and a lack of trust-\nworthiness outside narrow formats [40]. This has reinforced the\nconsensus that new evaluation frameworks are needed, ones that\nextend beyond exam accuracy to assess real-world clinical compe-\ntencies [51].\nIn response, researchers have begun creating specialized eval-\nuation sets targeting particular failure modes. MEDEC [2] is the\nfirst publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and\ncorrection in clinical notes. MedHallu [36] focuses on medical hal-\nlucination detection, comprising question-answer pairs from Pub-\nMedQA with deliberately fabricated answers, challenging a model\nto judge correctness, and results show that even top models strug-\ngle to reliably identify incorrect medical statements. In addition, as\nshown in Table 1, except for MEDIQA [1], a small dataset, the pro-\nportion of ADRD-related questions in each benchmark is generally\nbelow 3%, mostly under 1%. Collectively, these findings indicate\nthat ADRD-specific evaluation remains underdeveloped. We aim to\naddress this gap by introducing a benchmark focused on the ADRD\ndomain, which has been largely overlooked in prior works.\n2.2\nLLMs for ADRD Applications\nNatural language processing research in the ADRD field has tradi-\ntionally been dominated by ADRD detection tasks (e.g., automated\nscreening and diagnosis). For example, many works focus on screen-\ning for cognitive impairment [38], and numerous studies tackle the\ndiagnosis of dementia from patient speech or text [3]. A recent sys-\ntematic review found that about 56% of ADRD-related NLP studies\nfocus on detecting cognitive impairment, such as through classi-\nfying transcripts [38]. In contrast, far fewer studies have explored\nNLP for ADRD care and support. The same review identifies two\nemerging task categories beyond detection: caregiver support and\npatient assistance. However, only ∼6% of existing works fell under\ncaregiver support, highlighting the nascent state of this area [38].\nNevertheless, there is growing interest in applying NLP and\nLLMs to ADRD. Recent work explored caregiver-oriented dialogue\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "systems, such as ADQueryAid [17], which leverages ADRD-specific\nknowledge and retrieval augmentation to provide more relevant\nand supportive responses than general-purpose models, as well as\ndomain-adapted language models such as the Caregiving Language\nModel (CaLM) [37], fine-tuned on dementia care data. Beyond direct\nQ&A, LLMs have also been applied to analyze caregiver narratives\nand clinical texts, for example, to identify overburdened informal\ncaregivers from long-term care notes. Collectively, these studies\nillustrate the emerging interests in language technologies beyond\ndetection tasks, while highlighting the need for rigorous, ADRD-\nspecific evaluation.\nExisting medical benchmarks provide very limited coverage of\nADRD-related tasks, and the questions for evaluating models in\ndaily caregiving scenarios are even more scarce. As a result, highly\nrelevant ADRD caregiving questions, such as how to respond when\na patient becomes agitated at night, are absent from current evalua-\ntions, leaving little systematic, quantitative evidence of how LLMs\nperform in the realities of daily caring. To address this gap, we con-\nstruct an evaluation set that integrates the fragmented, knowledge-\noriented questions from seven existing healthcare benchmarks with\na complementary set of daily caregiving questions grounded on\nthe ABC model. Overall, this new benchmark dataset provides an\ninitial testbed for assessing LLM performance across both ADRD\nclinical knowledge and the practical, human-centered aspects of\ndaily care, enabling more realistic, rigorous, and targeted research\non ADRD-related LLM applications.\n3\nADRD Benchmark Construction\n3.1\nADRD Unified QA\nTo identify ADRD-related questions from existing benchmarks, we\nsearched 12 public benchmark datasets using ADRD domain key-\nwords containing “Alzheimer’s”, “Dementia”, “ADRD”, and “AD”.\nExcept for MEDIQA, the proportion of ADRD-related questions in\neach benchmark is below 3%, and most are under 1%. The propor-\ntion of MEDIQA is 13.05%; however, since MEDIQA contains 383\nquestions, 13.05% leads to 50 questions only. Across all benchmarks,\nthe total number of ADRD-related questions accounts for 0.64% of\ntotal non-generation task questions and 0.54% of generation task\nquestions, respectively. In addition, manual checking showed that\nthere were only seven questions in total about caregivers’ tasks.\nHere, a caregiver can be either formal or informal, defined as a\nperson who provides paid or unpaid assistance with daily living\nand cognitive support as a family member or close friend, or de-\nlivers such care as a non-nurse, non-medical licensed personnel\n(e.g., community health workers, certified nurse aides). These low\npercentages show that existing medical benchmarks contain only a\ntiny proportion of ADRD-relevant content, especially on caregiver\ntasks, indicating a substantial gap and leaving significant room for\nfuture exploration. The results are shown in Table 1.\nWe consolidated ADRD questions from seven existing non-\ngeneration task benchmarks in Table 1, including PubMedQA [20],\nHEAD-QA [45], MedBullets [12], MedMCQA [35], MedQA [19],\nMEDEC [2], and MedHallu [36]. These datasets have been the lead-\ning healthcare benchmarks to test SOTA LLMs [24, 40]. This led\nto a unified question and answer set, named ADRD Unified QA.\nWe retain the fully original benchmark content in its entirety with-\nout modification. MEDCALC-BENCH [22] is excluded from our\nbenchmark because we focus on evaluating models’ ADRD-related\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities, whereas this dataset empha-\nsizes numerical calculation and arithmetic reasoning. In addition,\nADRD Unified QA does not include generation tasks, as existing\nevaluation metrics are insufficient to reliably and consistently assess\nthe quality of LLM responses [40].\nTherefore, ADRD Unified QA consists of two primary question\ntypes. The first comprises multiple-choice questions designed to\nevaluate models’ knowledge of ADRD-related concepts, which were\nfrom PubMedQA, HEAD-QA, MedBullets, MedMCQA, and MedQA.\nThe second focuses on error detection, assessing models’ ability to\nidentify hallucinations and factual errors present in textual inputs,\nwhich were from MEDEC and MedHallu.\n3.2\nADRD Caregiving QA\nOne notable limitation of existing benchmarks is that ADRD ques-\ntions are almost exclusively framed as clinical knowledge or exam-\nstyle reasoning tasks, with almost no coverage of daily caregiving.\nFor instance, a manual check of the seven datasets used in section\n3.1 yielded only seven caregiving items. However, managing ADRD\nin real-world settings extends far beyond diagnosis and pharma-\ncological treatment, and largely revolves around day-to-day care-\ngiving challenges such as behavioral management, communication\nwith patients, safety supervision, and caregiver decision-making in\nhome and community settings.\nTo address this gap, we constructed an additional ADRD Caregiv-\ning QA set based on materials from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) pro-\ngram. The ABC program is a comprehensive, evidence-based model\nof care for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that\nhas been continuously developed, evaluated, and implemented for\nnearly two decades [4, 5, 27]. Supported initially by the U.S. Agency\nfor Healthcare Research and Quality, the ABC model was designed\nas a longitudinal, biopsychosocial intervention to address the com-\nplex clinical, behavioral, and caregiver challenges associated with\nADRD. In 2006, the program demonstrated efficacy in a random-\nized controlled trial, showing significant reductions in behavioral\nand psychological symptoms of dementia, caregiver burden, and\ninappropriate medication use among underserved populations with\nhigh social frailty [11]. Since then, the ABC program has been con-\ntinuously operated, refined, and scaled, serving more than 5,000\npatient–caregiver dyads [10, 15, 27]. Recognized by the National\nAcademies of Medicine, ABC integrates interdisciplinary team-\nbased care, non-pharmacologic interventions, caregiver support,\nmedication optimization, care coordination, and community part-\nnerships across the full ADRD trajectory. ABC directly informed the\ndevelopment of an alternative payment approach for comprehen-\nsive dementia care, later adopted by the U.S. Centers for Medicare\n& Medicaid Services through the GUIDE Model [9, 16]. As such,\nthe ABC program represents a mature, rigorously evaluated, and\npolicy-relevant standard for high-quality ADRD care.\nTherefore, the ABC program naturally serves as a solid founda-\ntion to extract benchmark questions. The ADRD Caregiving QA set\ncovers essential dimensions of ADRD-related caregiving, such as un-\nderstanding the condition, effective communication with patients,\nand behavioral management strategies. We follow a structured\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "abstraction process in which recurring caregiving situations and\nrecommended care strategies were identified from the education\ncontent and caregiver handout, and transformed into evaluable\nquestion-answer pairs. The resulting QA sets include 120 polar\n(True/False) QAs and 29 multiple-choice QAs. To ensure data qual-\nity, all constructed questions were reviewed and refined for accu-\nracy, clarity, and appropriateness by a senior clinician who served\nas the lead designer of the ABC program and has been involved in\nits development and refinement for two decades.\nAlthough modest in size, this question set provides targeted\ncoverage of ADRD daily caring scenarios that are largely absent\nfrom existing benchmarks. By integrating these questions with\nthe extracted ADRD Unified QA set, the ADRD-Bench enables a\nmore comprehensive evaluation of LLMs that spans both clinical\nknowledge and practical caregiving support for ADRD.\n3.3\nQuantitative and Qualitative Evaluations\nTo validate the performance of LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench,\nwe tested 33 LLMs as listed in Table 2, including both open-weight\nLLMs and closed-source LLMs. The open-weight LLMs included\ngeneral and medical LLMs, varying in size from 3.8B to 235B pa-\nrameters. This evaluation on a diverse set of models with different\nparameter scales and deployment settings not only helped establish\na comprehensive understanding of the models’ performance but\nalso the overall difficulty level of the benchmark across various\nmodel settings.\nFor open-weight models with 14.8B parameters or fewer, all\nexperiments were conducted on a local workstation with an NVIDIA\nRTX 6000 Ada Generation GPU (48 GB VRAM). For larger open-\nweight models with 32B parameters and above, experiments are\nconducted on an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure server with eight\nNVIDIA H100 GPUs (80 GB HBM3 memory each). All closed-source\ngeneral models were evaluated via their official APIs/terminals.\nFor quantitative evaluation, given that all tasks in our benchmark\nare formulated as discrete-choice questions, including multiple-\nchoice, True/False, and error sentence detection formats, we adopt\nexact match accuracy as the primary metric. A model’s prediction is\nconsidered correct if and only if the selected option exactly matches\nthe ground-truth label. For each model, we reported accuracies\nseparately for each set of the benchmark and the overall accuracy\naggregated across all questions.\nFor qualitative analysis, we focused on the newly proposed\nADRD Caregiving QA set to better understand model failures in\ndaily caregiving scenarios, which have not been covered in the liter-\nature. Specifically, we selected questions on which LLMs frequently\nproduced incorrect answers, as indicated by the quantitative results.\nThe selected cases were reviewed by our clinical expert to analyze\ncommon error patterns. The qualitative analyses were intended\nto contextualize the findings and highlight practical limitations of\ncurrent LLMs in daily caregiving scenarios.\n4\nResults and Analyses\nTable 2 shows the accuracy of 33 LLMs on each subset of ADRD\nUnified QA and ADRD Caregiving QA. LLMs are grouped into open-\nweight general, open-weight medical, and closed-source general\ncategories, with model size indicated where applicable. Boldface\nindicates the best performance for each task, while underlining\ndenotes the second-best result.\n4.1\nLLM Performance on ADRD Unified QA\nFigure 1 shows a significant, moderate-to-strong positive correla-\ntion (Pearson’s 𝑟= 0.5486, 𝑝= 0.0025) between model size and\naccuracy on the ADRD Unified QA set. Most smaller models in\nthe 4–7B parameter range achieved relatively low performance\n(approximately 0.45–0.75), whereas large models (70B+ parameters)\ndemonstrated substantially higher accuracy, mostly ≥0.85. More-\nover, most models with more than 30B parameters performed above\nthe overall mean accuracy (0.7972). The best-performing model was\nLlama-3.1-70B-Instruct [30], which achieved an accuracy of 0.9334.\nWhen comparing different model categories, open-weight medi-\ncal models (red points) generally tended to outperform open-weight\ngeneral models (blue points) of comparable size. Across the param-\neter scale, open-weight medical models were mostly positioned\nabove open-weight general models, highlighting the benefits of\ndomain-specific fine-tuning for clinical question answering and\nmedical error detection. However, an exception was observed for\nthe top-performing model, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct [30], which is\na general model and slightly outperformed the strongest medical\nmodel, Meditron3-70B [33] (0.9312). All closed-source general mod-\nels achieved performance above the overall mean accuracy, with\nGemini 2.5 Pro [14] performing the best among them, reaching an\naccuracy of 0.9142. Nevertheless, it was surpassed by several open-\nweight models (e.g., Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and Meditron3-70B)\nwith significantly fewer parameters. In addition, some open-weight\nmedical LLMs exhibited substantially lower accuracy than open-\nweight general models with similar parameter counts, indicating\nthat domain-specific fine-tuning does not universally guarantee\nsuperior performance.\nOverall, these results suggest that model size is an important\ncontributor to performance on the ADRD Unified QA benchmark;\nhowever, it does not fully determine model effectiveness. Domain-\nspecific fine-tuning may provide performance advantages in certain\ncases, but general models can still outperform specialized models,\npossibly due to stronger general reasoning capabilities and more ro-\nbust language representations learned from large-scale and diverse\npretraining corpora.\n4.2\nLLM Performance on ADRD Caregiving QA\nOn the ADRD Caregiving QA set (Figure 2), the performance gap be-\ntween smaller and larger models was narrower than that observed\non the ADRD Unified QA set. This may be attributed to the fact\nthat the questions in this benchmark focus more on daily living and\nare closer to “common-sense” reasoning, which is generally well\ncovered by large language models. Nevertheless, an upward trend\nin accuracy with increasing model size remained evident.

Across all models, the\nPearson’s correlation analysis revealed a significant and strong\npositive correlation between the two QA sets (𝑟= 0.6801, 𝑝=\n0.00001). This indicated that, at an aggregated level, models that\nperformed well on clinical questions also tended to achieve a higher\naccuracy on the caregiving questions.\nHowever, when examining different model categories separately,\nwe observed that only open-weight medical models exhibited this\nsignificant and strong correlation (𝑟= 0.8416, 𝑝= 0.0003). In\ncontrast, open-weight general models (𝑟= 0.2730, 𝑝= 0.3248)\nFigure 3: Correlation between accuracies on ADRD Caregiv-\ning QA and accuracies on ADRD Unified QA on all models,\nwhere larger points mean larger model parameters.\nFigure 4: Correlation between accuracies on ADRD Caregiv-\ning QA and accuracies on ADRD Unified QA on (a) general\nmodels; (b) medical models; (c) closed-source models.\nand closed-source models (𝑟= 0.4678, 𝑝= 0.4269) showed only\nweak-moderate, non-significant positive correlations. These results\ndemonstrated that open-weight medical models, which incorpo-\nrated specific medical fine-tuning, had more consistent performance\nacross both clinical and caregiving questions. A possible cause of\nthe non-significant correlations of the general models could be the\nrelatively small portion of medical data in model training, and thus\nthe models’ performance depends more on general common sense\nand social reasoning. This contributes to more socially appropriate\nresponses, a key point in daily caregiving. This analysis also aligned\nwith our earlier observation that, on ADRD Caregiving QA, open-\nweight general models achieved higher accuracy than open-weight\nmedical models at comparable parameter scales. On the other hand,\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "these findings also implied that, to develop healthcare LLMs that fit\nADRD care needs, more training data on caregiving tasks should\nbe included to balance the models’ knowledge and reasoning on\nthis aspect.\n4.4\nCase Analysis\nTo better understand large language model (LLM) performance\nbeyond accuracy metrics, we examined the models’ reasoning pro-\ncesses on ADRD Caregiving QA questions for which over 75% of the\nevaluated models generated incorrect answers. In reviewing these\nchallenging cases, feedback from a clinical expert was incorpo-\nrated to ensure that the analysis was grounded in real-world ADRD\ncaregiving principles. Two representative cases are presented to\nillustrate common failure patterns and model behaviors.\n4.4.1\nCase 1: True/False question. As shown in Figure 5, the correct\nanswer is “False,” as the statement overgeneralizes across all stages\nof Alzheimer’s disease. In the early stages, individuals are often still\nable to perform most basic activities independently, and the loss of\nself-care ability typically occurs in moderate to severe ADRD stages.\nHowever, 85% LLMs answered “True,” implying that all individuals\nwith Alzheimer’s disease are universally unable to manage daily\nliving activities. This result reflected a common failure pattern of\novergeneralization.\nFigure 6 shows LLMs’ reasoning steps obtained via Zero-Shot\nChain-of-Thought prompting. This zero-shot setting was selected to\nenable models to explicitly show their reasoning processes, while\nmitigating the influence of example selection biases. Complete\nprompts and outputs are in the Appendix.\nThe output of claude-opus-4-5-20251101 showed another typical\ntype of error. This model achieved an overall accuracy exceeding\n90% on the ADRD Caregiving QA and was able to distinguish be-\ntween different stages of Alzheimer’s disease and recognize that\npatients in the early stage generally retain the ability to perform\nactivities of daily living. However, this LLM based its final judgment\non a hallmark of the advanced stage and used it to generalize a\nconclusion across the entire disease course, producing an incor-\nrect answer. This suggested a tendency to rigidly focus on salient\nfeatures, while overlooking conditional factors like disease progres-\nsion. This could also be understood as a bias that when a fact was\ncommonly associated with a condition, some LLMs tended to treat\nit as a universal truth, without adequately reasoning about scope\nor exceptions.\n4.4.2\nCase 2: Multiple-Choice question. Figure 7 shows a multiple-\nchoice question example. In patients living with ADRD, losing eye\ncontact during a conversation often signals cognitive overload, fa-\ntigue, or a need to disengage, rather than a visual tracking problem.\nThus, the recommended approach is to respect the individual’s need\nfor space and reduce stimulation, rather than attempting to imme-\ndiately re-engage them. However, 79% LLMs chose “B”. It reflects\nan LLM tendency to treat behavioral cues as attention problems\nto be corrected, prioritizing task or conversation continuity over\nrespecting disengagement and emotion regulation.\nFigure 8 presents examples of LLMs’ key reasoning steps. The\nprompting and the entire outputs are in the Appendix. Both qwen3-\nmax-2025-09-23 and claude-opus-4-5-20251101 achieved an overall\nFigure 5: True/False question example of ADRD Caregiving\nQA that most LLMs answered incorrectly.\nFigure 6: Reasoning by llama3:8b-instruct-fp16 and claude-\nopus-4-5-20251101 of Case 1.\naccuracy of > 90% on the ADRD Caregiving QA. However, both\nfailed to answer this question. The models could identify that a\npatient living with dementia might experience attentional, percep-\ntual, or visual field challenges. Then, both subsequently treated\nthis partial clinical insight as sufficient justification for active re-\nengagement, recommending the caregiver to reposition and thus\nre-enter the individual’s visual field. This reasoning reflects a form\nof goal misalignment. Rather than evaluating caregiving interaction\nthrough the loss of eye contact, the models focused on preserving\nconversational continuity. In doing so, they implicitly assumed that\nmaintaining engagement is always desirable, failing to recognize\nthat, in ADRD care, averted gaze is often a low-intensity disengage-\nment or overload signal rather than a problem to be corrected. Un-\nlike errors stemming from a lack of medical knowledge, this failure\nis the inability to correctly interpret contextual qualifiers embed-\nded in dementia care, particularly those related to disengagement\nand emotion regulation. When demonstrating the understanding of\ndementia-related perceptual limitations, many LLMs emphasized\ncognitive characteristics more than care principles. As a result,\ndisengagement cues were framed as attention deficits, leading to\nrecommending actions that may increase pressure or distress.\n5\nLimitations and Ethical Considerations\nADRD-Bench does not involve confidential data. All content was\nderived from publicly available, de-identified resources. The ADRD\nCaregiving QA items were developed from widely used, clinically\nvalidated educational resources and reviewed by a clinician with\nnational expertise in comprehensive ADRD care to ensure quality\nand relevance. This benchmark is intended for research and evalua-\ntion purposes. We caution against the direct use of LLMs’ outputs\nin real-world clinical or caregiving settings without appropriate\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "Figure 7: Multiple-choice example of ADRD Caregiving QA\nthat most models answered incorrectly.\nFigure 8: Reasoning by qwen3-max-2025-09-23 and claude-\nopus-4-5-20251101 of Case 2.\nhuman oversight. Responsible use and safety should remain central\nconsiderations in downstream applications.\nAs the first and a preliminary benchmark, this work has sev-\neral limitations. Since the ADRD Unified QA portion was drawn\nfrom existing public benchmarks, there was a possibility that some\ncontext had been used in training certain models. Such exposure\ncould artificially boost performance scores. Current questions of\nADRD Caregiving QA are in multiple-choice or true/false format,\nwhich forces models to choose an answer even when they might be\nuncertain. This may alter performance scores by educated guesses\nor the exploitation of answer cues [28]. We did not include open-\nended generative tasks, since automatic evaluation of long-form\nresponses remains challenging [40]. As a result, this benchmark\nprimarily emphasizes factual correctness and does not measure a\nmodel’s ability in conversational interactions, such as proactively\ndemonstrating empathy.\nThe current questions are single-turn Q&A pairs. Multi-turn\ndialogues and interactive problem-solving are not included yet\nto test a model’s ability in carrying out extended conversations,\nsuch as counseling a caregiver through a stressful situation over\nseveral exchanges, an important aspect of real-world AI assistance.\nIn addition, caregiving decisions are often context-dependent and\nmay vary across patient needs and professional perspectives. At this\nstage, ADRD-Bench only covers a small scope of ADRD knowledge,\nand it should be expanded by the broader community in future\niterations for better coverage and precision.\nFinally, the benchmark is developed in English and rooted in the\nABC model, primarily focusing on ADRD care in the U.S. Therefore,\nADRD-Bench’s generalizability to other languages and healthcare\nsystems needs further investigation. Note that achieving high accu-\nracy on this benchmark does not guarantee an LLM will be reliable\nor effective in real clinical or home-care deployment. The bench-\nmark is a step toward identifying strengths and weaknesses. Users\nshould be cautious not to over-interpret the results, but use them\nin accordance with other necessary evaluations (e.g., user studies).\n6\nConclusion, Discussion, and Future Work\nWe presented ADRD-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to ADRD.\nBy curating 1,352 ADRD-focused questions from seven existing\nmedical QA datasets and introducing 149 daily caregiving ques-\ntions from national, widely adopted caregiver education materials,\nthis work provided an evaluation platform for both factual clinical\nknowledge and practical caregiving reasoning. The evaluation of\nSOTA LLMs on ADRD-Bench yielded several key findings. On one\nhand, top models achieved high accuracies on questions (best per-\nformance was 0.9334 on ADRD Unified QA and 0.9664 on ADRD\nCaregiving QA, respectively). On the other hand, failure modes\nbeyond numerical accuracy were discovered. For example, LLMs\noften overgeneralize clinical facts and sometimes fail to identify the\nmajor goal in a question [23]. Therefore, high overall accuracy does\nnot guarantee true competency in ADRD care [23]. Even advanced\nLLMs may produce misguided responses due to shallow reasoning\nor misalignment with care goals [44]. Our benchmark and evalua-\ntion together lay a groundwork for rigorously assessing LLMs in a\nhigh-impact, yet underdeveloped area of medical AI [41].\nTo ensure safer and more effective AI for ADRD care, domain-\nspecific alignment techniques that bridge the gap between clinical\nknowledge and caregiving practices should be a focus in future\nresearch [44]. This benchmark and our findings reinforce the im-\nportance of rigorous, targeted evaluation in high-stakes domains.\nAs with any other medical specialty, ADRD care is a complex and\nevolving field [6]. As a result, benchmark questions and answers\nneed to be updated in a timely manner according to the state-of-the-\nart practice and research. We encourage the broader community to\nbuild on this work to advance safe, reliable, and compassionate AI\nin the ADRD domain.\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was partially supported by the National Science Foun-\ndation under Grant No. 2426639.

This implies that\nthe patient has difficulty with tasks such as bathing, dressing, eating, and using the bathroom, among others. These are essential\nskills for independent living, and if someone is unable to perform them, it suggests a significant impairment in their cognitive or\nphysical abilities.\nAnswer: Yes\n}\nReasoning by claude-opus-4-5-20251101:\n{\nReasoning:\nThe question asks whether Alzheimer’s patients are unable to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs).\nAlzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. The impact on daily\nliving activities depends on the stage of the disease:\n1. Early stage: Patients may have mild memory problems but can generally still perform most ADLs independently (bathing,\ndressing, eating, toileting, etc.)\n2. Middle stage: Patients begin to have more difficulty with ADLs and may need assistance with some tasks.\n3. Late/Advanced stage: Patients typically lose the ability to perform basic ADLs and require full-time care and assistance.\nThe question states \"The Alzheimer’s patient\" in a general sense, implying the condition overall. In advanced stages of Alzheimer’s\ndisease, patients do become unable to perform basic activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, eating, and using the toilet\nindependently.\nSince the question appears to be asking about a characteristic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (particularly in its progression), and\ninability to perform ADLs is indeed a hallmark of advanced Alzheimer’s disease, the answer would be yes - Alzheimer’s patients\n(especially in later stages) are unable to perform basic activities of daily living.\nAnswer: Yes\n}\n15\n"}, {"page": 16, "text": "Reasoning Output for Multiple-Choice Case\nReasoning by qwen3-max-2025-09-23:\n{\nReasoning:\nWhen caring for someone with dementia, maintaining effective communication is crucial. Individuals with dementia often\nexperience difficulties with attention, perception, and processing sensory information. Losing eye contact may indicate that they\nare distracted, overwhelmed, or simply have shifted their visual focus due to cognitive changes—not necessarily disinterest or\ndefiance.\nOption A suggests moving closer and increasing body language, which could be perceived as intrusive or overwhelming, especially\nif the person is already feeling overstimulated.\nOption B involves following the patient’s gaze and repositioning to stay in their visual field. This is a respectful, non-confrontational\nway to re-establish connection without demanding attention. It aligns with best practices in dementia care, which emphasize\nadapting to the person’s current state rather than forcing engagement.\nOption C assumes the person needs space, but losing eye contact doesn’t always mean they need a break—it might just reflect\ndifficulty maintaining focus. Pausing unnecessarily could disrupt meaningful interaction.\nOption D calling their name firmly and reminding them of the topic—can come across as scolding or pressuring, which may\nincrease anxiety or confusion.\nOption E assumes the issue is auditory distraction, but the problem described is loss of eye contact (a visual cue), not lack of\nhearing or response to speech.\nTherefore, the most appropriate action is to gently reposition yourself within their visual field to support their ability to re-engage\nnaturally.\nAnswer: B\n}\nReasoning by claude-opus-4-5-20251101:\n{\nReasoning:\nWhen caring for someone with dementia, maintaining effective communication requires understanding their cognitive and\nperceptual challenges. Let me analyze each option:\nA. Moving closer and using increased body language - While body language is helpful, moving closer without repositioning to\ntheir visual field may not address the core issue of lost eye contact. This could also feel intrusive.\nB. Following the patient’s gaze and repositioning yourself to remain in their visual field - This approach acknowledges that\npeople with dementia may have difficulty tracking movement or maintaining focus. By repositioning yourself to where they’re\nlooking, you work with their current attention rather than against it. This is a person-centered, non-confrontational approach.\nC. Recognizing they need space and pausing - While sometimes appropriate, automatically assuming they need space when eye\ncontact is lost may not be the best first response. The loss of eye contact could simply be due to visual field issues or distraction,\nnot necessarily a need for space.\nD. Calling their name firmly and reminding them of the topic - This approach can be perceived as confrontational or demanding,\nwhich can increase anxiety and agitation in people with dementia. It’s generally not recommended to use firm tones or put\npressure on them.\nE. Checking for environmental noise and increasing volume - While environmental factors matter, simply increasing volume\ndoesn’t address the visual attention issue and could be startling or perceived as aggressive.\nThe best practice in dementia care is to adapt to the person’s current state and work within their capabilities. Option B represents\na gentle, person-centered approach that maintains connection without being demanding or intrusive.\nAnswer: B\n}\n16\n"}]}
