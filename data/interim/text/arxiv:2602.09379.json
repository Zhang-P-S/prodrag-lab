The di-\nagnosis of mental disorders relies heavily on clinical interviews,\nwhere psychiatrists must synthesize patient-reported symptoms,\nbehavioral observations, and medical history according to standard-\nized criteria [16]. However, the global shortage of mental-health\nprofessionals severely restricts timely psychiatric assessment, creat-\ning a pressing need for scalable diagnostic-support tools. Although\nLLMs have advanced rapidly, current psychiatric-AI benchmarks\nremain insufficient for evaluating diagnostic capability in realistic\nclinical scenarios. Existing benchmarks exhibit three major limita-\ntions: (1) most rely on template-based synthetic dialogues that lack\nrealistic conversational variability; (2) they often omit key patient\ninformation needed for differential diagnosis and rarely include\nclinician-verified diagnostic labels; (3) few support dynamic, multi-\nturn consultation, preventing evaluation of information-gathering\nstrategies.\nTo address these limitations, we propose LingxiDiagBench, the\nfirst large-scale, real-data-driven, multi-disease diagnostic bench-\nmark for psychiatric consultation in Chinese, as shown in Figure 1.\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows: First, we con-\nstruct LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 synthetic consultation\ndialogues derived from real electronic medical records and tran-\nscripts. Second, we design three diagnostic tasks with increasing\ndifficulty: binary classification (depression vs. anxiety), four-way\nclassification (including comorbidity of depression and anxiety), and\n12-category ICD-10 code multi-label prediction. Third, we develop\nan agent-based evaluation framework comprising Patient Agents\nsimulating realistic patient behavior, Doctor Agents implementing\ndiverse consultation strategies, and Diagnosis Agents performing\nevidence-based diagnosis. Fourth, we conduct extensive experi-\nments across state-of-the-art LLMs and baseline methods, revealing\nsubstantial performance gaps. Notably, we release the synthetic\ndataset, consultation framework, and evaluation code. We encour-\nage the community to leverage the framework and benchmark to\nadvance the development of AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis mod-\nels, in order to improve access to accurate and timely psychiatric\ndiagnosis in real-world scenarios.\n2\nRelated Work\nRecent medical-AI evaluation has undergone a paradigm shift from\nstatic knowledge tests toward realistic clinical-dialogue simulation,\nwith growing emphasis on synthetic data construction and end-to-\nend diagnostic task evaluation [4, 9, 10]. Psychiatric AI benchmarks\nhave followed a parallel trajectory; as summarized in Table 1, re-\ncent efforts increasingly incorporate data synthesis and diagnostic\nassessment, yet current benchmarks span diverse but partial evalu-\nation dimensions. Early efforts such as PsychiatryBench [6] focus\non multi-task assessment, including knowledge recall, safety de-\ntection, and reasoning through static question-answering, yet they\nlack interactive consultation capability. Conversational datasets\nlike MentalChat16K [5] offer dialogue data for mental health assis-\ntance but emphasize empathetic response generation rather than\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "LingxiDiagBench: A Multi-Agent Framework for Benchmarking LLMs in Chinese Psychiatric Consultation and Diagnosis\nKDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju, Korea\nTable 1: Comparison of existing benchmarks for mental health and psychiatric AI evaluation.

Safety concerns have also received attention,\nwith Psychosis-Bench [15] specifically testing whether models rein-\nforce delusional content, addressing critical harm-prevention while\nremaining narrow in diagnostic scope. Moreover, multi-turn ther-\napeutic dialogue evaluation has been explored in MindEval [3],\nwhich incorporates both patient and clinician perspectives but\nprioritizes therapeutic quality over diagnostic precision. More re-\ncently, MentraSuite [17] advances mental health reasoning through\nits MentraBench component, evaluating five core reasoning dimen-\nsions including appraisal, diagnosis, intervention, abstraction, and\nverification, yet primarily assesses reasoning chains rather than\nend-to-end consultation workflows. Despite these efforts, critical\ngaps remain. Existing benchmarks rarely incorporate clinically used\ndiagnostic labels, provide limited support for multi-turn diagnostic\nconsultation, and seldom adopt agent-based paradigms that decou-\nple patient simulation from diagnostic reasoning—features essential\nfor evaluating LLMs in realistic psychiatric workflows.\n3\nDataset\n3.1\nLingxiDiag-Clinical dataset\nClinical recordings and reports were collected from approximately\n4,500 outpatients at the Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC) be-\ntween 2023 and 2024 [18]. We preprocessed the audio, anonymized\npersonally identifiable information, and transcribed it via auto-\nmated speech recognition, followed by manual verification to en-\nsure accuracy. Afterward, we curated 1,709 cases with well-annotated\nelectronic medical records (EMRs) and verified transcriptions to\nform the LingxiDiag-Clinical dataset. The study protocol was re-\nviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the SMHC Insti-\ntutional Review Board, ensuring compliance with ethical research\nstandards. Informed consent was obtained from each participant or\ntheir legal guardian prior to participation.\n3.2\nLingxiDiag-16K dataset\nTo enable scalable evaluation while protecting patient privacy, we\ngenerated LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 synthetic consulta-\ntion dialogues with synthetic EMRs. The generation process pre-\nserved the demographic and clinical distributions observed in the\nreal patient population. Each case in LingxiDiag-16K includes com-\nplete patient profiles comprising demographics, chief complaints,\npresent illness history, past medical and psychiatric history, family\nhistory, and diagnostic conclusions. To align the synthetic distribu-\ntion with the real data, we first extracted demographic and clinical\nfeatures from the collected cases to construct a knowledge graph.\nWe then generate synthetic EMRs by sampling from this graph\naccording to the empirical distribution in the real data. As shown\nin Table 2, LingxiDiag-16K closely matches the real data distribu-\ntion across age groups, gender, and diagnostic groups. Moreover,\nLingxiDiag-16K reproduces age-dependent social patterns and lin-\nguistic properties of clinical records, as illustrated in Figure 2 and\nFigure 3 in the Appendix, respectively. For LingxiDiag-16K, we\ngenerated 16,000 synthetic cases, randomly selected 1,000 samples\neach for validation and testing, and preserved the same distribution\nacross splits. Dialogues in LingxiDiag-16K are generated through\nour multi-agent framework, where a Qwen3-32B-powered Ameri-\ncan Psychiatric Association (APA)-guided Doctor Agent interacts\nwith the LingxiDiag-Patient, followed by a proper polishing for\nthe inconsistency. We elaborate on this multi-agent generation\nframework in the subsequent sections.\nTable 2: Demographic and diagnostic comparison between\nLingxi-Clinical and LingxiDiag-16K datasets.\nCategory\nLingxiDiag-Clinical\nLingxiDiag-16K\nDiff\nSample Size\nN\n1,709\n16,000\n–\nAge\nMean±SD\n36.4±10\n32.1±12.0\n–\n0–18\n0.8\n7.7\n+6.8\n18–25\n18.3\n22.4\n+4.1\n25–35\n33.7\n33.6\n−0.1\n35–45\n24.7\n19.9\n−4.8\n45–55\n13.0\n9.8\n−3.3\n55–65\n5.9\n4.4\n−1.5\n65+\n3.6\n2.1\n−1.5\nGender\nMale\n32.3\n32.4\n+0.1\nFemale\n67.7\n67.6\n−0.1\nF32 (Depressive Episode)\n35.2\n34.8\n−0.4\nF41 (Anxiety Disorders)\n22.1\n22.5\n+0.4\nF43 (Stress-related)\n12.3\n12.1\n−0.2\nF31 (Bipolar Disorder)\n8.7\n8.9\n+0.2\nF42 (OCD)\n5.4\n5.6\n+0.2\nF20 (Schizophrenia)\n4.8\n4.5\n−0.3\nF45 (Somatoform)\n3.9\n4.1\n+0.2\nF51 (Sleep Disorders)\n3.2\n3.3\n+0.1\nF39 (Unspecified Mood)\n2.1\n2.0\n−0.1\nF98 (Childhood-onset)\n1.5\n1.4\n−0.1\nOthers\n0.8\n0.8\n0.0\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju, Korea\nShihao et al.\n3.3\nPatient Agent\nThe Patient Agent aims to simulate realistic outpatient behavior\nduring psychiatric consultation. Following existing work [3, 20],\nthe patient agent is prompted by a pretrained LLM augmented\nwith structured patient profiles constructed from real clinical data,\nincluding demographics, chief complaints, present illness history,\nand diagnostic information. In addition to the patient profile, we\nalso provide the conversation history as context to guide response\ngeneration, so that the patient agent behaves more like a real pa-\ntient during the synthetic consultation. However, compared to real\npatient responses, we observed that LLM-simulated responses ex-\nhibit several unnatural characteristics: (1) they tend to be longer,\n(2) symptoms are often disclosed all at once rather than gradually,\nand (3) the language is overly polished and lacks colloquial natural-\nness. Therefore, we enhance the patient agent by incorporating a\ncarefully designed set of prompts to elicit more natural responses.\nWe also control response length by sampling target lengths from\nthe empirical distribution in the real clinical data. We refer to this\nenhanced patient agent as LingxiDiag-Patient, which provides a\nmore suitable prompting context than prior approaches [3, 20].\n3.4\nDoctor Agent\nThe Doctor Agent simulates a psychiatrist consultation behavior\nwhen interacting with the Patient Agent. We implement four con-\nsultation strategies to accommodate different clinical reasoning\napproaches. First, the Free-form strategy employs LLMs instructed\nto act as senior psychiatrists conducting clinical interviews without\nexternal guidance. The Doctor Agent autonomously selects ques-\ntioning directions based on patient responses and determines when\nsufficient information has been collected for diagnosis. Second, we\nadapt the Symptom-Tree strategy, which uses symptom-based deci-\nsion trees derived from MDD-5K diagnostic protocols as described\nin [20]. However, a key limitation of the symptom-tree approach is\nthat it requires a predefined and finite set of symptoms. As the num-\nber of potential target disorders increases, the clinician may need\nto query many symptoms to progressively narrow down the diag-\nnostic space. To address this limitation, we adopt an APA-guided\nstrategy that follows a five-phase clinical guideline: screening (chief\ncomplaints and symptom duration), assessment (core symptom de-\ntails and functional impairment), deep-dive (specific symptoms\nand underlying causes), risk assessment (suicide and self-harm\nscreening), and closure (key information confirmation). Finally, we\nevaluate a retrieval-augmented variant of APA-Guided, denoted\nAPA-Guided + MRD-RAG [11], which provides the retrieved the\ndiagnostic guideline of top 3 potential diagnosis to support the\nnext-question planning during consultation. Each phase includes\nmandatory and optional topics with explicit transition criteria (see\nAppendix C.4 for the complete Doctor Agent prompt and Appen-\ndix C.5 for the diagnostic tree structure).\n3.5\nDiagnosis Agent\nThe Diagnosis Agent performs a psychiatric diagnosis based on\ncomplete consultation transcripts between the Doctor and Patient\nAgents. Unlike the Doctor Agent, which conducts real-time ques-\ntioning, the Diagnosis Agent receives the full dialogue history and\nproduces diagnostic conclusions with supporting clinical rationales.\nWe use different prompts for the three diagnostic tasks (see Appen-\ndix C.3).\n4\nBenchmark Evaluation Framework\nLingxiDiagBench comprises two evaluation paradigms: static eval-\nuation (LingxiDiagBench-Static) using synthetic EMRs and dia-\nlogues as ground truth, and dynamic evaluation (LingxiDiagBench-\nDynamic) where models interact with Patient Agents in real-time\nconsultation. The static evaluation paradigm focuses on repro-\nducible evaluation based on fixed consultation transcripts, while the\ndynamic evaluation paradigm evaluates end-to-end consultation,\nwhere Doctor Agents interact with Patient Agents in real time and\nthen provide diagnostic conclusions.\n4.1\nLingxiDiagBench-Static\nThe LingxiDiagBench-Static benchmark consists of two tasks: as-\nsisted diagnosis and doctor next question prediction. The assisted\ndiagnosis task requires predicting psychiatric diagnoses from com-\nplete consultation dialogues, and we evaluate performance at three\ndifficulty levels aligned with clinical diagnostic challenges. First,\nthe binary classification task distinguishes patients with depression\nfrom patients with anxiety, focusing on samples without comor-\nbidity. This task evaluates the fundamental ability to differentiate\nbetween the two most prevalent outpatient psychiatric conditions.\nSecond, the four-way classification task extends to four categories:\npure depression, pure anxiety, mixed depression-anxiety, and other\npsychiatric conditions. This task introduces the challenge of rec-\nognizing comorbidity patterns and identifying when presentations\nfall outside the primary diagnostic focus. Third, the twelve-way\nclassification task spans major ICD-10 psychiatric categories: F20\n(schizophrenia), F31 (bipolar disorder), F32 (depressive episode), F39\n(unspecified mood disorder), F41 (anxiety disorders), F42 (obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder), F43 (stress-related disorders), F45 (somato-\nform disorders), F51 (sleep disorders), F98 (childhood-onset dis-\norders), Z71 (counseling), and Others. This task requires broad\ndifferential diagnosis capabilities across heterogeneous conditions,\nincluding comorbidity condition prediction. We first employ TF-IDF\nmethods to extract features with logistic regression, support vector\nmachines, and random forest classifiers. For LLMs, we evaluate a\nbroad range of model families, including the Qwen3 series (1.7B, 4B,\n8B, 32B) [19], the Baichuan series (Baichuan-M2-32B, Baichuan-M3-\n235B) [12], the Kimi series (K2-Thinking) [14], the DeepSeek series\n(DeepSeek-V3.2) [2], Google Gemini (Gemini-3-Flash) [13], Ope-\nnAI GPT (GPT-OSS-20B, GPT-5-Mini) [8], and Anthropic Claude\n(Claude-Haiku-4.5) [1]. We apply zero-shot inference to evaluate\nall LLMs on the same 1000 samples in LingxiDiagBench-Static, en-\nsuring a consistent evaluation setting. We report accuracy, macro\nF1-score, and weighted F1-score for all classification tasks. For the\ntwelve-way task, we additionally report Top-1 and Top-3 accuracy\nto capture cases where the correct diagnosis appears among the\ntop differential diagnoses.\nThe doctor’s next question prediction task evaluates understand-\ning of consultation flow by predicting the next appropriate doctor\nquestion given dialogue context. This task assesses whether models\ncan generate clinically appropriate follow-up questions that ad-\nvance diagnostic reasoning.

To improve\nrobustness, we aggregate judgments from three evaluator models\n(Gemma-3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B, and Qwen3-30B-A3B). Appendix C.1\nprovides the full evaluation prompts and the definitions of the evalu-\nation dimensions. Moreover, based on LingxiDiag-16K, we standard-\nize the prompting context so that different patient agents respond\nto the same set of doctor questions under identical conditions. The\nevaluation dimensions are organized into two groups. Factual con-\nsistency includes accuracy and honesty, while the remaining four\ndimensions—response brevity, information proactivity, emotional\nrestraint, and language polish—evaluate the naturalness of the pa-\ntient agent responses.\nDoctor Agent Evaluation: Similar to [3], we evaluate Doc-\ntor Agent consultation quality using LLM-as-a-Judge methodology\nacross five clinically relevant dimensions (information complete-\nness, symptom exploration depth, differential diagnosis awareness,\nrisk assessment, and communication quality), each scored on a 1–6\nLikert scale using GPT-4o as the evaluator (see Appendix C.2 for\ndetailed evaluation prompts). For dynamic diagnosis, we report the\nsame diagnostic accuracy metrics as static evaluation across three\ndiagnostic tasks: accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score\nfor 2 and 4-class classification tasks, as well as accuracy, Top1 ac-\ncuracy, Top3 accuracy, macro F1-score, and weighted F1-score for\n12-class classification tasks. The key difference is that diagnosis\nfollows interactive consultation rather than analysis of pre-existing\ntranscripts, where the base models are not only doing diagnosis\nbut also lead the diagnostic consultation.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nPatient Agent Evaluation\nIn Table 3, we present a comprehensive evaluation of Patient Agent\nquality across different backbone models and data sources. All di-\nmensions are scored on a 1–5 scale, with evaluation conducted using\na three-model fusion (Gemma-3-27B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-30B-\nA3B). LingxiDiag-Patient Agents substantially outperform their\nMDD-5K counterparts across all behavioral authenticity dimen-\nsions, attributable to refined prompt engineering and output length\ncontrol, where Qwen3-32B attains the highest Overall score of 4.67.\nMost of the LLMs excel in the Accuracy dimension, reflecting su-\nperior adherence to patient background profiles. Real clinical data\nserves as the ground-truth reference with an Overall score of 4.30,\nwhich may be due to occasional misalignment between recorded\nconversations and EMR histories in authentic clinical settings. Over-\nall, current LLMs adhere closely to the provided profiles and can\nappropriately refuse to answer questions when the required infor-\nmation is not available in the background context. Therefore, in\nthe dynamic benchmark, we utilize Qwen3-32B as the backbone\nmodel for the patient agent.\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "KDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju, Korea\nShihao et al.\nTable 4: LingxiDiagBench–Static evaluation results on LingxiDiag-16K.

For differential depression and anxiety, accuracy is\nhigh across methods, reaching 0.854 on LingxiDiag-16K (Gemini-3-\nFlash) and 0.887 on LingxiDiag-Clinical (Qwen3-4B). For the 4-class\ntask, performance drops to around 0.39–0.48 accuracy, with TF-IDF\n+ RF achieving 0.479 on LingxiDiag-16K and Qwen3-32B achieving\n0.524 on LingxiDiag-Clinical. For the 12-class task, the best 12-class\naccuracy on LingxiDiag-16K is 0.409 (GPT-5-Mini), while the best\nmacro F1 on LingxiDiag-Clinical is 0.278 (Qwen3-32B), and the best\nTop-3 accuracy is 0.698 (Qwen3-4B). Overall, TF-IDF + LR attains\nthe best Overall score on LingxiDiag-16K (0.533), and Qwen3-32B\nachieves the best Overall score on LingxiDiag-Clinical (0.548).\nTable 5 presents results for the psychiatrist’s follow-up ques-\ntion prediction, which evaluates models’ understanding of consul-\ntation flow on both synthetic (LingxiDiag-16K) and real clinical\n(LingxiDiag-Clinical) data. Overall, models demonstrate compara-\nble performance, with BLEU scores ranging from approximately\n20% to 23% and BertScore ranging from 72% to 84%.\n5.3\nDynamic Benchmark Results\nTable 6 presents the comprehensive evaluation of Doctor Agents\nacross both LLM-as-a-Judge consultation quality dimensions and\ncomplete diagnostic classification performance, including all met-\nrics for 2-class, 4-class, and 12-class tasks. We compare four doctor\nstrategies, including Free-form, Symptom-Tree, APA-Guided, and\nAPA-Guided + MRD-RAG.\nDynamic results are summarized in Table 6. The 2-class accuracy\ncan reach 92.3% (DeepSeek-V3.2 under APA-Guided + MRD-RAG),\nbut performance decreases substantially for 4-class and 12-class\ntasks. The best 4-class accuracy is 43.0% (Grok-4.1-Fast under APA-\nGuided + MRD-RAG), and the best 12-class accuracy is 28.5% (Grok-\n4.1-Fast under APA-Guided + MRD-RAG), as shown in Figure 8.\nTop-1 accuracy peaks at 37.5% for 12-class prediction (Grok-4.1-Fast\nunder APA-Guided + MRD-RAG), indicating that correct diagnoses\nare often present in candidates but remain difficult to rank as the\nprimary label. Overall, stronger consultation quality does not con-\nsistently translate into higher diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that\ndiagnostic reasoning and interviewing skills need to be optimized\nseparately. Detailed model-level comparisons for each strategy are\nprovided in Appendix Figures 5–8.\n6\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nWe present LingxiDiagBench, a comprehensive benchmark for eval-\nuating AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis through agent-based con-\nsultation simulation. LingxiDiagBench provides two complemen-\ntary evaluation paradigms: static evaluation for reproducible dia-\nlogue analysis and dynamic evaluation for interactive consultation\nassessment. The benchmark spans three difficulty levels from bi-\nnary depression-anxiety classification to twelve-way differential\ndiagnosis, enabling systematic assessment of diagnostic capabilities\nacross varying clinical complexity. Through extensive experiments\nencompassing state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish comprehensive\nperformance baselines that reveal both the current capabilities and\ncritical limitations of AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis.\nA fundamental challenge in building dynamic consultation bench-\nmarks lies in the simulation environment itself, particularly the\nfidelity of Patient Agents. Our evaluation demonstrates that the\nLingxiDiag-Patient Agents achieve Overall scores of 4.07–4.67 out\nof 5 (Table 3), with the best configuration (Qwen3-32B, 4.67) sur-\npassing even the real clinical data baseline (4.30), whereas MDD-5K-\nPatient counterparts score only 2.23–4.09 under identical evaluation.\nThis performance gap underscores the importance of prompt design\nand domain-specific optimization for realistic patient simulation.\nHowever, despite matching real data distributions, current Patient\nAgents still exhibit limitations in capturing the full diversity of indi-\nvidual patient presentations and communication styles. Designing\nmore personalized and authentic patient simulation environments\nthat can serve as effective training grounds for Doctor Agents re-\nmains an open research challenge.\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "LingxiDiagBench: A Multi-Agent Framework for Benchmarking LLMs in Chinese Psychiatric Consultation and Diagnosis\nKDD ’26, August 09–13, 2026, Jeju, Korea\nTable 5: Doctor question prediction task results on LingxiDiag-16K and LingxiDiag-Clinical Dataset.

The diagnostic accuracy in dynamic set-\ntings often falls below that observed in static evaluation, indicating\nthat ineffective information-gathering strategies can impair down-\nstream diagnostic reasoning and reduce end-to-end performance.\nThis finding aligns with current reinforcement learning-based train-\ning paradigms that emphasize learning through interaction. No-\ntably, different consultation strategies (Free-form, Symptom-Tree,\nAPA-Guided, and APA-Guided + MRD-RAG) yield varying diag-\nnostic outcomes, demonstrating that how to ask questions is as\nimportant as what diagnostic conclusions to draw. We observe that\nadding MRD-RAG to APA-Guided can improve end-to-end diag-\nnostic performance on LingxiDiag-16K in the dynamic setting with\nan increase of 5% in overall classification performance (Table 6).\nWe further conduct the dynamic evaluation using real patient pro-\nfiles and dialogues from the LingxiDiag-Clinical dataset in place\nof LLM-simulated patients. As shown in Table 8 in the Appen-\ndix, APA-Guided + MRD-RAG still yields the highest consultation\nquality (LLM-Ovl up to 4.09 for GPT-OSS-20B), consistent with\nthe synthetic-data findings. However, for diagnostic classification,\nthe Symptom-Tree strategy with GPT-OSS-20B achieves the best\nClf-Ovl of 50.0, outperforming APA-Guided + MRD-RAG, which\ndiffers from the synthetic-data setting, where APA-Guided + MRD-\nRAG leads. Diagnostic accuracy on real patient data is generally\nhigher (e.g., 2-class accuracy up to 91.2%, 12-class accuracy up to\n47.0%), likely because real clinical cases present more prototypi-\ncal symptom patterns. This discrepancy between the two settings\nsuggests that the benefit of retrieval-augmented strategies may be\ndata-dependent, warranting further investigation.\nIn the dynamic consultation evaluation, the LLM-as-a-Judge\nscores for dialogue quality exhibit an overall positive correlation\nwith model scale, and proprietary models generally outperform\nopen-source alternatives. However, the correlation between LLM\ndialogue quality scores and classification task performance is mod-\nerate (r = 0.43), suggesting that high-quality consultation behavior\ndoes not automatically translate to accurate diagnostic outcomes.\nThis decoupling indicates substantial room for improvement in\ncurrent models’ diagnostic reasoning capabilities, even when their\nconsultation conduct appears clinically appropriate. Besides, inte-\ngrated optimization of both consultation behavior and diagnostic\ndecision-making, rather than relying solely on model scale, repre-\nsents an important direction for advancing AI-assisted psychiatric\ndiagnosis.\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting our\nfindings. First, although LingxiDiag-16K is constructed to match the\ndistribution of a large real-world clinical dataset, it inevitably differs\nfrom authentic clinical encounters in certain aspects, with limited di-\nversity in rare presentations and atypical symptom profiles. Second,\nour benchmark primarily targets Chinese psychiatric consultation\nscenarios, with prompts implemented in Chinese; this design choice\nmay not elicit optimal performance from models primarily trained\non other languages, limiting cross-lingual generalizability. Third,\nour current evaluation focuses on initial outpatient diagnosis and\ndoes not address treatment planning, follow-up assessment, or lon-\ngitudinal care coordination; future work will extend the benchmark\nto cover these additional clinical workflow stages.\nIn conclusion, LingxiDiagBench establishes a standardized plat-\nform for benchmarking AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis, combin-\ning real clinical data with large-scale synthetic cases to enable both\nauthentic and scalable evaluation. Our comprehensive experiments\nidentify key challenges, including patient simulation fidelity, the\ngap between static and dynamic evaluation, comorbidity recogni-\ntion, and the decoupling between consultation quality and diagnos-\ntic accuracy. These resources aim to accelerate the development\nof AI systems that can ultimately improve access to accurate and\ntimely psychiatric diagnosis while highlighting the current limita-\ntions that necessitate careful validation before clinical deployment.\n7\nEthical Use of Data\nData provenance and privacy.

LingxiDiagBench is de-\nsigned exclusively for research purposes to advance AI-assisted\npsychiatric diagnosis and consultation modeling. It is not a clin-\nical diagnostic tool and must not be deployed in real clinical set-\ntings without rigorous validation, regulatory approval, and human\noversight. Synthetic dialogues may reflect biases inherited from\nthe source clinical data and LLMs used in generation; users must\nconduct thorough bias audits and fairness evaluations before any\ndownstream application. We acknowledge potential risks, including\ninappropriate clinical adoption, algorithmic bias amplification, and\nthe possibility that realistic synthetic dialogues could be misused to\ntrain systems without adequate safety guardrails.

Information Proactivity: 5 (Human): Only answers what’s asked, doesn’t proactively supplement. May even give off-topic or perfunctory\nanswers. 1 (AI): Doctor asks one point, patient says three. Adds extensive background, reasons, timeline, details.\n3. Emotional Restraint: 5 (Human): Restrained or absent emotional expression. Doesn’t proactively describe feelings, uses rough simple words\n(“annoyed,” “tired,” “don’t want to talk”). 1 (AI): Excessively describes emotional states, deliberately uses figurative metaphors (“heart feels pressed\ndown,” “feeling of losing control”).\n4. Language Polish: 5 (Human): Colloquial, careless language. May have typos, grammatical errors, incomplete sentences, or no rhetoric. 1 (AI):\nOverly fluent and complete language.
