Systems must express confi-\ndence that is calibrated to reflect uncertainty, main-\ntain consistency between internal preferences and\ngenerated recommendations, and adopt an appro-\npriate risk posture for the clinical context. For\nexample, favoring over-triage over under-triage in\nhigh-risk cases (Alaa et al., 2025). Ensuring safe,\nconsistent, and steerable behavior is a prerequi-\nsite for real-world clinical integration (Alaa et al.,\n2025; Artsi et al., 2025). Yet, current LLMs exhibit\nmisalignment between latent decision signals and\nsurface-level outputs (Wang et al., 2024b; Artsi\net al., 2025). This lack of response consistency\ncan lead to inappropriate escalation or missed risk,\neven when clinical evidence remains unchanged.\nOne widely used intervention for steering LLM\nbehavior is persona conditioning, in which mod-\nels are contextualized with professional roles or\ninteraction styles (Cintas et al., 2025; Salemi et al.,\n2024). In clinical settings, such conditioning is\noften assumed to improve realism, professional-\nism, or task performance by aligning model outputs\nwith domain-specific norms (Gaber et al., 2025).\nHowever, the actual behavioral consequences of\npersona conditioning, particularly in high-stakes\nmedical decision-making, remain poorly charac-\nterized, with limited understanding of when such\npriors improve performance, when they degrade it,\nand what safety-relevant trade-offs they introduce.\nPrior work has explored personas as a mech-\nanism for steering LLM behavior, often to elicit\ndiverse or adversarial responses (Deng et al., 2025)\nor to simulate different user roles (Kyung et al.,\n2025).\nIn clinical contexts, personas have pri-\nmarily been used to model patient-side variation,\nsuch as demographic or linguistic differences, or\nto simulate clinician agents for workflow emu-\nlation and multi-agent collaboration (Kim et al.,\n2024b; Kyung et al., 2025; Gaber et al., 2025).\nThese studies show that personas shape model out-\nputs, but they often rest on an implicit assumption:\nthat more expert personas uniformly yield safer\n1\narXiv:2601.05376v1  [cs.AI]  8 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "Figure 1: Experimental framework for analyzing personas as behavioral priors in clinical LLMs. Personas are\ninjected via system prompts (A). Models are evaluated on two clinical tasks, yielding decision labels, free-text\njustifications, and latent logit scores (B). Behavioral effects are quantified using automated metrics and assessed\nqualitatively through blinded LLM-based rankings, with validation by expert clinicians (C).\nor higher-quality behavior. This assumption re-\nmains largely untested in clinical decision-support\nsettings, where inappropriate risk posture or mis-\ncalibration has serious consequences. Our find-\nings reveal that persona conditioning produces\nsystematic but non-monotonic effects: medically\ngrounded personas improve emergency-triage per-\nformance yet degrade outcomes in primary-care\ntasks, and interaction styles modulate but do not\nreliably control risk posture. These results show\nthat personas act as behavioral priors that intro-\nduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guar-\nanteed pathways to safer or more expert clinical\nbehavior.\nOur Contribution. We provide an experimen-\ntal framework to conduct a systematic analysis of\nmedical personas as behavioral priors in clinical\nLLMs (Figure 1). We evaluate model behavior\non triage and patient-safety tasks, examining how\nprofessional roles and interaction styles modulate\nperformance, risk posture, and reasoning quality.\nTo operationalize the desirable properties outlined\nabove, we introduce a suite of behavioral metrics:\nconsistency rate, risk propensity, risk sensitivity,\nand calibration. We complement automated metrics\nwith human and LLM-based evaluations to capture\na broader range of behavioral nuances. Together,\nthese measures enable a granular decomposition of\nhow persona conditioning shapes clinical decision-\nmaking and risk alignment in safety-critical set-\ntings.\n2\nRelated work\nPersonas as Behavioral Steering Mechanisms\nPersonas are widely used to steer LLM behavior\nby framing models as particular roles or agents\n(Shanahan et al., 2023; Hwang et al., 2023; Wang\net al., 2024a). Prior work has employed role con-\nditioning to elicit diverse behaviors, support adver-\nsarial testing through persona-driven red-teaming,\nor simulate different user perspectives (Deng et al.,\n2025; Li et al., 2025). Recent studies show that\nrole-playing personas can influence model reason-\ning and output characteristics, suggesting that per-\nsonas offer a flexible mechanism for shaping behav-\nior (Kim et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2024). How-\never, existing evaluations provide limited examina-\ntion of how persona-conditioned outputs are per-\nceived by human evaluators, or how these percep-\ntions relate to safety-critical properties such as cali-\nbration, consistency, and risk posture in high-stakes\ndecision-making.\nPersonas in Healthcare Contexts In healthcare,\npersonas have primarily been used to model patient-\nside variation to construct datasets and evaluate\nrobustness (Kyung et al., 2025) and to instantiate\nclinician agents for workflow emulation and multi-\nagent collaboration (Kim et al., 2024b; Gaber et al.,\n2025). While these approaches demonstrate the\nutility of personas for simulation and interaction\nstudies, they generally assume that professionally\ngrounded personas improve clinical reasoning and\ntask performance. Whether such personas system-\natically affect safety-relevant behavior, calibration,\nconsistency, and risk posture in decision-support\nsettings remains largely unexplored.\nLatent Persona Representations and Func-\ntional Consequences Beyond prompt-based condi-\ntioning, recent work has identified latent activation-\nspace representations associated with behavioral\n2\n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "traits such as sycophancy or hallucination propen-\nsity (Chen et al., 2025; Golovanevsky et al., 2025).\nThis line of research emphasizes mechanistic in-\nterpretability and training-time control of internal\nbehavioral tendencies. While promising, such ap-\nproaches operate at the level of model internals and\ntypically require specialized access during training\nor inference, which may not be available in typi-\ncal deployment settings, including clinician-facing\nclinical systems (Mesinovic et al., 2025). More-\nover, the connection between these latent represen-\ntations and their functional consequences on com-\nplex reasoning tasks, especially in safety-critical\nclinical decision-making, remains poorly under-\nstood.\n3\nPersona Conditioning Framework\nWe structure our study around three research ques-\ntions:\n• RQ1: How does persona conditioning affect\nclinical performance and safety?\n• RQ2: How do interaction styles influence\nmodel risk posture?\n• RQ3: How do LLM judges and clinicians per-\nceive persona-induced differences?\n3.1\nPersonas as Behavioral Priors\nWe study persona conditioning as a single-factor\nbehavioral intervention for steering LLM behav-\nior in clinical decision-making tasks. Our evalu-\nation spans two safety-critical clinical scenarios:\n(i) clinical triage, encompassing emergency triage\n(high-acuity, time-sensitive cases) and primary-\ncare triage (lower-acuity cases), and (ii) patient-\nsafety recommendations. Personas are designed to\nreflect roles and interaction styles that may impose\ndistinct behavioral priors under safety pressure.\nFollowing prior work (Gaber et al., 2025; Kim\net al., 2024b), each persona condition is instan-\ntiated by appending a one-sentence role-defining\ninstruction at the system level using the template:\nYou are a {persona}.\nAll persona variants differ only in this declaration;\ntask instructions, inputs, decoding parameters, and\nlabel extraction procedures are held fixed across\nconditions. Personas are defined along two orthog-\nonal axes: professional role and interaction style,\nas summarized in Figure 1.\nProfessional role\nThis axis encodes the occupa-\ntional context. We define personas corresponding\nto an Emergency Department (ED) physician and\nan ED nurse, reflecting distinct clinical responsi-\nbilities and authority levels in high-stakes decision-\nmaking environments.\nInteraction style\nTo isolate stylistic effects while\nholding the professional role constant, we vary the\nED physician persona by specifying the interaction\nstyle. We define bold and cautious variants, en-\nabling analysis of risk modulation independent of\nrole identity. This dimension is applied exclusively\nto the ED physician persona to limit the experimen-\ntal search space.\nNon-medical controls\nWe include two non-\nmedical control conditions: a standard Helpful\nAssistant persona and a No Persona condition in\nwhich the system prompt is left unmodified. These\ncontrols establish a baseline for distinguishing clin-\nically grounded persona effects from generic assis-\ntant behavior.\n3.2\nBehavioral Evaluation Dimensions\nTo characterize the effects of the persona condition-\ning, we evaluate model behavior across comple-\nmentary dimensions, capturing performance, risk\nposture, and decision stability.\n3.3\nQuantitative Metrics\nAccuracy\nAccuracy is measured as the propor-\ntion of model predictions that match reference la-\nbels for each task. While accuracy remains a nec-\nessary baseline for evaluating clinical utility, it is\ninsufficient to characterize safety-critical behavior\nin clinical settings.\nRisk propensity\nRisk propensity is defined as\nthe frequency with which a persona assigns high-\nurgency labels (e.g., “Emergency”) across all cases,\nirrespective of reference severity. This metric cap-\ntures the model’s inherent bias toward escalation\nand reflects its default clinical posture under uncer-\ntainty.\nRisk sensitivity\nRisk sensitivity is assessed by\nanalyzing error asymmetry conditioned on refer-\nence labels. Errors are categorized as:\n• Type I Error (Over-triage): Assigning high\nurgency to a low-risk case. This constitutes\na conservative failure mode that prioritizes\npatient safety at the cost of resource efficiency.\n• Type II Error (Under-triage): Assigning\nlow urgency to a high-risk case. This rep-\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "resents a permissive failure mode that risks\ndelayed care and adverse clinical outcomes.\nWe define a persona’s risk sensitivity as the rel-\native prevalence of Type I versus Type II errors\n(ETypeI/ETypeII), computed over evaluation in-\nstances where an error occurs. Importantly, neither\nerror type is uniformly preferable; the appropriate\nbalance depends on clinical context. This analy-\nsis tests whether personas shift safety behavior in\na targeted manner rather than inducing a uniform\nchange in decision frequency.\nConsistency Rate\nPrior work (Wang et al.,\n2024b) has shown that the latent and generated\nlabels in LLMs can diverge substantially. We adapt\nthis insight as a diagnostic probe to assess whether\npersona conditioning primarily modulates decod-\ning behavior or latent preferences. For each input,\nwe perform a single generation pass using fixed\ndecoding parameters and extract two labels:\n• Latent preference (ylogit): the highest likeli-\nhood class from a valid set {A, B, C}, com-\nputed using standard logit-based evaluation\n(Gao et al., 2024; Hendrycks et al., 2020;\nWang et al., 2024b).\n• Generated label (ygen): the class parsed from\nthe generated output.\nThe Consistency Rate (CR) is the percentage of\nvalid, parsable responses where the generated label\nmatches the logit-predicted label:\nCR = 100× 1\nN\nPN\ni=1 1(ygen,i = ylogit,i), where\nN is the number of valid, parsable responses (un-\nparsable outputs are excluded). A high CR indi-\ncates strong alignment between latent preferences\nand generated outputs, meaning the model gener-\nates outputs that align with its internal scoring. A\nlow CR signals that contextual or decoding effects\nshift the response away from the latent ranking.\nThis analysis tells us whether persona effects op-\nerate primarily through decoding-level modulation\n(reducing consistency) rather than shifts in latent\npreferences (preserving consistency).\nCalibration\nIn safety-critical clinical settings,\nusers may rely on calibrated probabilities to quan-\ntify model uncertainty (Shorinwa et al., 2025). We\nassess calibration to determine whether a model’s\npredicted probability for a chosen decision aligns\nwith its empirical correctness. For each input, we\ncompute conditional log-likelihoods for all valid\nlabels in V and apply a softmax to obtain a prob-\nability distribution over categories. Calibration is\nquantified using Expected Calibration Error (ECE)\n(Naeini et al., 2015). Lower ECE indicates bet-\nter alignment between predicted confidence and\nempirical accuracy. Unlike internal consistency,\ncalibration evaluates the reliability of confidence\nestimates rather than agreement between scoring\nand generation.\n3.4\nQualitative Metrics\n3.4.1\nLLM-based Evaluation\nTo assess qualitative aspects not captured by ag-\ngregate performance metrics, we employ a panel\nof three distinct LLMs as judges following prior\nwork (Verga et al., 2024), to mitigate biases from\na single evaluator. Judges evaluate model outputs\nalong two criteria:\n1. Clinical Reasoning Quality: Judges assess\ndecision justification quality, measuring clini-\ncal plausibility and coherence of the reasoning\ntrace.\n2. Safety Compliance:\nJudges evaluate (i)\nharmfulness, (ii) helpfulness, and (iii) factual\naccuracy relative to medical knowledge.\nFor each input,\njudges are presented with\nanonymized responses generated under different\npersonas and are asked to rank them according to\nthe applicable criteria. Aggregated rankings for\neach persona are measured using Mean Reciprocal\nRank (MRR), =\n1\nN\nPN\ni=1\n1\nranki , where ranki de-\nnotes the position assigned to a persona’s response,\nfor instance i.\n3.4.2\nHuman Clinician Evaluation\nRecent work increasingly relies on LLM-based\njudges to evaluate model behavior (Verga et al.,\n2024; Sanni et al., 2025), yet it remains unclear\nwhether such automated preferences align with ex-\npert clinical judgment in safety-critical settings.\nWe therefore conduct a blinded clinician evalua-\ntion to assess (i) whether persona-driven behavioral\ndifferences identified by LLM judges are percepti-\nble to human experts, and (ii) whether LLM-judge\npreferences correspond to clinician assessments of\nclinical utility and safety.\nThree clinicians participated in the evaluation:\ntwo attending physicians with over ten years of clin-\nical practice and one recent medical graduate. The\nclinicians were presented with paired, anonymized\nmodel responses and asked to indicate which re-\nsponse they preferred based on overall clinical util-\nity and perceived safety.\nTo isolate persona effects and ensure that evalu-\nated cases exhibit clear behavioral contrasts, we em-\n4\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "Figure 2: Persona effects on Clinical Triage.

For each\ntask category, we select 50 instances in which all\nthree LLM judges unanimously agreed in ranking\none persona over the others (25 medical-preferred\nand 25 non-medical-preferred). This design en-\nables a direct comparison of LLM-judge prefer-\nences with expert clinical judgment for cases with\nstrong, consistent signals. We collected their re-\nsponses via the Argilla annotation platform (see\nAppendix E for details).\n4\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate persona-driven behavior across two\nmedical domains: clinical triage classification and\nopen-ended patient-facing safety interactions.\nClinical Triage\nWe use a cohort of 1,466 emer-\ngency department patients with suspected tran-\nsient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke (2013–2020)\nfrom an urban academic observational unit (Kha-\ntri et al., 2025). Each case includes structured\nintake features (e.g., presenting symptoms, vital\nsigns, and medical history). To extend coverage\nto lower-acuity scenarios, we supplement this co-\nhort with 201 symptom-based routine-care cases\n(Fraser et al., 2023). Reference triage labels re-\nflect clinically appropriate care at presentation and\nserve as the evaluation target. The task is framed\nas a three-way classification: (A) stay home/self-\ncare, (B) seek routine or primary care, or (C) seek\nemergency care.\nPatient Safety Compliance\nWe use PatientSafe-\ntyBench (Corbeil et al., 2025), a publicly avail-\nable dataset, which probes adherence to five safety\ncategories: harmful medical advice, misdiagnosis\nand overconfidence, unlicensed medical practice,\nhealth misinformation, and bias or stigmatization\nacross 466 queries. It consists of open-ended pa-\ntient queries designed to elicit safety-relevant be-\nhaviors. Model responses are analyzed to assess\nhow persona conditioning affects safety, factuality,\nand helpfulness in patient-facing interactions.\nPersona Conditioning Models\nWe evaluate per-\nsona interventions across five state-of-the-art clini-\ncal LLMs. Our primary cohort is the HuatuoGPT-\no1 series (Chen et al., 2024) designed for ad-\nvanced medical reasoning. We evaluate four vari-\nants with different backbones: HuatuoGPT-o1-8B\n(LLaMA-3.1-8B), HuatuoGPT-o1-70B (LLaMA-\n5\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "3.1-70B), HuatuoGPT-o1-7B (Qwen2.5-7B), and\nHuatuoGPT-o1-72B (Qwen2.5-72B). For compari-\nson, we include MedGemma-27B (Sellergren et al.,\n2025); unlike the HuatuoGPT-o1 series, it does not\ngenerate reasoning traces.\nJudge Models\nFor LLM-based evaluation (Sec-\ntion 3.4.1), we use a panel of three models: GPT-5,\nHuatuoGPT-o1-70B, and HuatuoGPT-o1-72B. Us-\ning multiple judges provides diverse perspectives\nand reduces bias from any single evaluator. Full\nprompt templates and persona formulations are pro-\nvided in Appendix D.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor task-level performance,\nwe conduct paired significance testing between\npersona-conditioned and baseline prompts. Binary\noutcomes (accuracy and consistency rate) are eval-\nuated using McNemar’s non-parametric test with\ncontinuity correction on matched evaluation in-\nstances. For LLM-based pairwise rankings, we ap-\nply a paired t-test to MRR scores across instances.\nUnless otherwise stated, statistical significance is\nassessed at p < 0.05.\n5\nResults\n5.1\nPersona-Induced Shifts\nFigure 2 illustrates that across models and settings,\nmedical personas induce systematic but context-\ndependent behavioral shifts. In emergency care sce-\nnarios, conditioning with emergency-oriented per-\nsonas (ED Physician, ED Nurse) consistently im-\nproves task performance relative to the Helpful As-\nsistant and No Persona baselines. These improve-\nments manifest as gains in accuracy (≈+20 pp)\nand improved calibration (≈−20 pp), with sev-\neral effects reaching statistical significance. Effects\non consistency are more model-dependent. While\nlarger models such as HuatuoGPT-72B show no-\ntable gains in consistency (≈+4 pp), other models\nexhibit mixed or neutral effects. This suggests that\npersona-induced improvements operate through\ndistinct mechanisms across models: some bene-\nfit from increased alignment between latent pref-\nerences and generation (consistency), while oth-\ners improve primarily through gains in accuracy\nand calibration. The consistent gains under ED\nPhysician and ED Nurse personas indicate that role-\nspecific conditioning influences decision-making\npolicies beyond surface-level style.\nIn primary care scenarios, however, the same\nmedical personas frequently degrade performance.\nWe observe reductions in accuracy (≈−10 pp),\nsubstantial drops in consistency for some smaller\nmodels (≈−20 pp), and worsening calibration\nrelative to non-medical baselines. This reversal\nsuggests that personas optimized for high-acuity\ncontexts become misaligned when applied to lower-\nacuity clinical tasks.\nWhen aggregated across all cases, these oppos-\ning effects cancel each other out, yielding mod-\nest net improvements. Overall, these results indi-\ncate that medical persona conditioning functions\nas a context-sensitive behavioral prior, improving\nperformance under high-acuity conditions and de-\ngrading performance in lower-acuity settings rather\nthan yielding uniform gains. Crucially, these ef-\nfects become visible only through systematic, task-\nstratified evaluation across multiple behavioral di-\nmensions; aggregate accuracy or single-task anal-\nyses would mask both the benefits and the safety-\nrelevant failure modes induced by persona condi-\ntioning.\nFigure 3: Interaction style effects Risk Propensity (left)\nand Risk Sensitivity (right) on Clinical Triage.\n5.2\nInteraction-Style Effects\nHolding the ED Physician role constant, we com-\npare cautious and bold variants against the base\nprofiles using risk propensity and risk sensitivity.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3, interaction style induces\nmeasurable, non-monotonic, and directionally in-\nconsistent shifts in risk behavior across models.\nIn some models (HuatuoGPT-72B, MedGemma-\n27B, and HuatuoGPT-7B), both bold and cau-\ntious variants modestly increase risk propensity\n(up to +0.04) relative to the ED Physician base-\nline. For HuatuoGPT-72B and 7B, the cautious\nvariant exhibits higher risk propensity than the\nbold variant (e.g., 0.72 vs. 0.69 for 72B). In\ncontrast, for MedGemma-27B and HuatuoGPT-\n8B, the ordering is reversed, with bold variants\n6\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "(a) Patient Safety Compliance (medical roles).\n(b) Clinical Triage (medical roles).\n(c) Patient Safety Compliance (interaction styles).\nFigure 4: Performance on LLM-based evaluation.

Risk sensitiv-\nity exhibits even stronger model dependence, with\nsome models (HuatuoGPT-70B, MedGemma-27B,\nand HuatuoGPT-7B) being substantially more risk-\nsensitive than others (HuatuoGPT-72B and 8B).\nRelative to the ED Physician baseline, the cautious\nvariant increases risk sensitivity for HuatuoGPT-\n72B, HuatuoGPT-70B, and HuatuoGPT-7B (e.g.,\n0.14 vs. 0.01 for 72B). In contrast, Bold variants\nexhibit higher risk sensitivity for MedGemma-27B\nand HuatuoGPT-8B (e.g., 0.73 vs. 0.53 for 27B).\nOverall, medical roles induce higher risk propen-\nsity and risk sensitivity than non-persona base-\nlines, with increases of up to 0.21 in propen-\nsity (HuatuoGPT-7B) and up to 0.76 in sensitivity\n(HuatuoGPT-70B). However, interaction style does\nnot provide a monotonic or reliable mechanism for\ncontrolling risk posture. These results demonstrate\nthat interaction style is not a reliable control mech-\nanism for clinical risk posture. Stylistic prompts\nproduce directionally inconsistent effects that chal-\nlenge their use as safety controls in high-stakes\ndecision-making.\n5.3\nLLM Judge Preferences\nGround-truth labels are often unavailable in clini-\ncal decision support settings, requiring evaluation\nbased on perceived safety and reasoning quality.\nFocusing on larger models, we assess whether LLM\njudges systematically prefer certain persona and\ninteraction-style variants in perceived safety, help-\nfulness, and justification quality.\nAcross all evaluation datasets, inter-annotator\nagreement on the top-ranked personas is low (be-\ntween 43% to 53% majority agreement; 0 to 0.1\nCohen’s κ); when rankings are aggregated across\ncases, statistically significant differences emerge\nbetween persona conditions. This indicates that per-\nsona effects manifest as consistent population-level\nshifts in perceived quality rather than as unanimous\ncase-level preferences. On Patient Safety Compli-\nance, Figure 4a shows that medical personas are\nranked higher than non-medical baselines in per-\nceived safety (lower harmfulness), helpfulness, and\nfactual accuracy, with several differences reaching\nstatistical significance. Figure 4c shows that inter-\naction styles introduce trade-offs: cautious variants\nare often perceived as safer than bold variants, al-\nthough their relative ordering with respect to the\nbase medical persona is model-dependent. Cru-\ncially, these aggregate gains mask critical, category-\nspecific degradations (Appendix F).\nFor emergency triage justifications (Figure 4b),\nmedical\npersonas\nare\nagain\npreferred\nover\nnon-medical baselines, with ED Physician receiv-\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "(a) Confidence distribution of human clinicians’ preferences.

Importantly, these rank-\nings reflect perceived alignment and justification\nquality rather than task correctness or guaranteed\nclinical safety.\n5.4\nClinician Preferences\nHere, we examine whether LLM-based judgments\nalign with expert clinician preferences.

While clinicians reach moderate agree-\nment on safety compliance judgments (average Co-\nhen’s κ = 0.43 in medium- and high-confidence\ncases), agreement on justification quality could\nnot be computed as 95.9% of the responses had\nlow confidence levels (Figure 5b). Overall, hu-\nman evaluation suggests that medical personas im-\nprove perceived safety compliance, whereas their\neffects on justification quality in clinical triage are\nambiguous and inconsistent, even among expert\nclinicians. This validates LLM judges on safety\ncompliance and, to a lesser extent, on reasoning\nquality: clinicians prefer medical personas for both,\nwith stronger confidence and consensus on safety.\nMedical personas, therefore, improve perceived\nsafety more reliably than justification quality, a\ndistinction clarified by human evaluation.\n6\nConclusion\nDespite the widespread use of persona prompting\nas a lightweight mechanism for steering LLMs, its\nrole in high-stakes decision-making remains fun-\ndamentally understudied. In this work, we show\nthat persona conditioning functions as a behavioral\nprior that systematically reshapes the model’s risk\nposture, consistency, and failure modes. Through\na multidimensional evaluation spanning clinical\ntriage and medical safety red-teaming, we demon-\nstrate that the effects of medical personas are\nstrong, measurable, and, more crucially, non-\nmonotonic and context-dependent. Our findings\nreveal persona conditioning as a double-edged in-\ntervention, underscoring the need for context-aware\nevaluation and deployment. More broadly, our re-\nsults challenge the assumption that stronger domain\ngrounding uniformly improves safety, and motivate\na shift toward interpretable, task-conditional eval-\nuation frameworks for controllable LLM behavior\nin high-stakes domains.\n8\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "7\nLimitations\nThis study provides an essential framework to con-\nduct a systematic analysis of medical personas\nas behavioral priors for LLMs in clinical settings.\nHowever, this work has some limitations that will\nbe addressed in future work. First, we evaluate\na limited set of professionally grounded personas,\nfocusing on Emergency Department (ED) roles and\ninteraction styles. While appropriate for studying\nhigh-acuity decision-making, this does not cover\nthe whole space of clinically relevant roles (e.g.,\nprimary care physicians or specialists), which may\nexhibit different behavioral effects under persona\nconditioning. Second, our evaluation emphasizes\ntasks with clearly varying clinical criticality: clini-\ncal triage (spanning emergency and primary care\ncategories) and patient safety recommendations,\nwhich span five critical categories. Consequently,\nnon-monotonic and context-dependent effects are\nmost pronounced in triage, where risk posture dif-\nferences are explicit, and less pronounced in pa-\ntient safety benchmarks, where criticality is more\nuniform and aggregate trends can mask category-\nspecific failures. Third, although we include both\nLLM-based and human clinician evaluations, the\nhuman assessments are limited in scale due to an-\nnotation costs and expertise requirements. As a\nresult, our human evaluation focuses on trends in\npreference and agreement rather than fine-grained\ncase-level judgments. Finally, we study persona\nconditioning as a lightweight, prompt-based inter-\nvention and do not evaluate training-time or latent-\ncontrol methods, which may provide stronger guar-\nantees but are less common and less accessible\nfor deployment. Our conclusions, therefore, apply\nspecifically to prompt-level persona conditioning\ncommonly used in clinical LLM systems. Despite\nthese limitations, our results show that even mini-\nmal persona conditioning can induce large, context-\ndependent behavioral shifts, highlighting the need\nfor systematic evaluation prior to deployment.\n8\nEthical Consideration\nOur work aims to understand how medical behavior\npriors affect model behavior in critical care tasks\nand test the assumption that medical personas guar-\nantee safety and expertise. Our research follows\nethical guidelines to ensure fair treatment of all par-\nticipants. All annotators were volunteers and au-\nthors in this paper. This study uses two distinct data\nsources with differing release policies: The datasets\nused in Clinical Triage task are derived from real,\nde-identified patient records obtained from collabo-\nrating institutions under existing IRB-approved pro-\ntocols. To protect patient privacy and comply with\nethical guidelines for secondary use, these datasets\ncannot be released publicly. They will be made\navailable upon reasonable request to requesting re-\nsearchers under a formal Data Use Agreement with\nthe hosting institution, in accordance with estab-\nlished controlled-access protocols for de-identified\nclinical data. The dataset used for the Patient Safety\nCompliance task is a publicly available dataset de-\nsigned for safety evaluation that contains no real\npatient information. No additional IRB review was\nrequired for this study as it involves secondary anal-\nysis of previously collected, de-identified data and\ndoes not involve new interaction with human sub-\njects. No personally identifiable information is\npresent in any released outputs or analyses.\nReferences\nAhmed Alaa, Thomas Hartvigsen, Niloufar Golchini,\nShiladitya Dutta, Frances Dean, Inioluwa Deborah\nRaji, and Travis Zack. 2025.

Our annotation guidelines closely fol-\nlowed the evaluation criteria provided to the LLM\njudge - the only difference being that the LLM\njudge ranked all persona responses, while the hu-\nman annotators were only required to choose the\nbetter from two persona responses. The responses\nselected for human evaluation were those where the\nLLM judges had a clear consensus for medical (25\ninstances) and non-medical (25 instances) personas.\nThe annotators thus indicated preference between\ntwo responses (one from medical persona and one\nfrom non-medical persona) at a time. This ensured\nthat evaluation cases exhibited clear behavioral con-\ntrasts and clinicians were not overly burned with\nhigh cognitive load of evaluating low contrast re-\nsponses from multiple personas. The annotators\nwere provided with the following information:\n• the task prompt provided to the clinical LLM\nfor the two tasks;\n• two model responses (thinking traces plus\nfinal response label for assessing reasoning\nquality in clinical triage and model responses\nfor patient safety compliance);\n• annotation guidelines that explained the task\nsetup, judgment parameters (same as provided\nto the LLM judge), and annotator confidence\nlevels.\nThe annotators returned their preference between\nthe two responses and additionally their confidence\nlevel, between 0-100.\nThree clinicians, based in the US and Germany,\nvolunteered in the blinded evaluation: Clinician\nA & B: Attending physicians with >10 years of\nclinical experience. Clinician C: Recent medical\ngraduate (MD completed within the last year). All\nclinicians are fluent in English and have experience\nin emergency or primary care settings. They were\nblinded to model identities, persona labels, and\nthe source of each response during the evaluation.\nEach annotator was individually given an orienta-\ntion about the annotation tasks and was provided\nwith a documentation to refer to during the anno-\ntation process. The clinicians contributed to the\nhuman evaluation as part of the research team and\nare co-authors on this paper.\nE.2\nAnnotation Platform\nWe collected the annotations on the Argilla data an-\nnotation platform, https://argilla.io/, a free\nopen-source tool to annotate datasets. We deployed\nthe Argilla UI on a private server, created two\ndatasets for the two task-specific judgment criteria\n(reasoning quality and safety compliance), each\ncomprising 50 instances. We created three user\naccounts, one for each annotator. The annotators\nwere then provided with the link to each dataset\nand their individual login credentials. They were\ngiven one week to complete the task.\nE.3\nStatistics\nWe received 149 responses for the reasoning quality\nand 150 responses for the safety compliance evalua-\ntions. These responses were manually inspected to\nremove any formatting issues, for instance, trailing\nspaces and additional comments in the text input\nfield for confidence level reporting.\nF\nPatient Safety Results\nF.1\nCategory-Level LLM-Judge Evaluation\nPatient Safety Bench tasks span five clinically rel-\nevant safety categories. Using LLM judges, we\nevaluate persona-conditioned outputs along three\ndimensions: Safety (perceived harmfulness), Help-\nfulness, and Factual Accuracy for the HuatuoGPT-\n72B and HuatuoGPT-70B models. Figures 6 and 7\nsummarize persona effects across safety categories.\nOverall, medical personas are often but not uni-\nformly preferred over non-medical baselines. Im-\nportantly, persona conditioning can degrade perfor-\nmance in specific safety-critical categories, reveal-\ning model and category-dependent failure modes.\n13\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "Figure 6: Category level persona effects on patient safety tasks (HuatuoGPT-72B Model).\nFigure 7: Category level persona effects on patient safety tasks (HuatuoGPT-70B Model).\nAcross both models, non-medical baselines\n(Helpful Assistant, No Persona) are consistently\nranked lower on average, reflected by fewer high-\nranking (green) cells across evaluation dimensions.\nIn HuatuoGPT-72B, medical personas generally\noutperform non-medical baselines in Misdiagnosis,\nHarmful Medical Advice, and Bias & Discrimina-\ntion across all dimensions. Similarly, HuatuoGPT-\n70B shows medical personas leading in Misdiagno-\nsis, Health Misinformation, and Bias & Discrimi-\nnation.\nHowever, this aggregate trend masks substan-\ntial heterogeneity and critical reversals.

In HuatuoGPT-70B, No Persona\noutperforms the ED Physician on both Safety and\nHelpfulness in Unlicensed Medical Practice, while\nthe ED Nurse yields lower Factual Accuracy than\nthe Helpful Assistant for Misdiagnosis and Health\nMisinformation. This suggests that persona condi-\ntioning may inadvertently trigger ’overconfidence’\nor latent biases associated with professional roles,\nleading the model to prioritize a specific behavioral\nprior over the underlying safety guardrails present\nin the base assistant.\nTaken together, these results demonstrate that\npersona conditioning does not provide a uniformly\nsafer response profile. Instead, personas interact\nwith model-specific weaknesses, sometimes ampli-\nfying risk rather than mitigating it. This highlights\nthe necessity of category-level and model-specific\nevaluations when deploying persona-conditioned\nclinical LLMs, as aggregate safety improvements\ncan be deceptive.\n14\n"}]}
