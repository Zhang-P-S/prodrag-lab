Their integration into healthcare, however, introduces profound safety concerns given \ntheir potential to directly influence patient outcomes and clinical decisions. To mitigate these risks, \nLLMs require domain-specific adaptations, including pre-training on medical corpora and \nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to better align outputs with established \nclinical guidelines and ethical standards (1). Despite such efforts, persistent challenges remain, \nencompassing accuracy limitations, opacity in decision-making, biases, privacy risks, and \naccountability issues in real-world deployment. Nevertheless, LLMs offer substantial promise for \nimproving efficiency and effectiveness in clinical practice, education, and research, highlighting \nthe imperative for rigorous safety evaluations. Recent evidence further demonstrates that medical \nLLMs remain susceptible to targeted adversarial manipulations, such as misinformation attacks, \nwhich can elicit harmful recommendations with high confidence (2). \n   A prevalent issue is the growing reliance of individuals on online tools, including LLMs, for \nself-assessment of health conditions without professional consultation, posing risks to accuracy, \nreliability, and patient safety (3). These interactions are frequently shaped by user biases, leading \nto amplified misinformation (4), a vulnerability compounded by limited public ability to discern \npotential harms (5). \n   Empirical studies underscore these dangers. When non-experts evaluate AI-generated medical \nresponses blindly alongside those from specialists, they often rate AI outputs as comparable or \nsuperior in comprehensiveness, validity, reliability, and satisfaction, even when the AI content \ncontains inaccuracies (6). This misplaced trust extends to behavioral intent, with users expressing \nwillingness to act on flawed AI advice similarly to physician recommendations, potentially \nresulting in acceptance of ineffective or harmful guidance and raising liability concerns (7). \n   Medical LLMs exhibit heightened vulnerability to adversarial inputs, where prompt injections \nor contaminated data can bypass safeguards, yielding unsafe outputs or failures to defer to \nspecialists in critical scenarios (8, 9). \n"}, {"page": 3, "text": "   In comparison to static applications, chatbots provide personalized, interactive, and responsive \nsupport tailored to individual needs in real time. Research reveals that parents harbor diverse \ninformational requirements for managing pediatric conditions at home and generally view chatbots \npositively for this purpose (10). Consequently, in pediatric medicine, anxious parents with limited \nmedical knowledge frequently seek immediate and definitive guidance. Such queries often involve \nurgent, insistent, or barrier-expressing language that unintentionally exerts adversarial pressure. \nThis pressure can potentially erode model safeguards and provoke unsafe responses, such as \ninappropriate definitive diagnoses or omitted referrals in emergencies, thereby endangering child \nhealth. \n   Although substantial research has evaluated LLMs through neutral benchmarks focused on \ntechnical accuracy and general medical safety, systematic investigation of their robustness under \nauthentic real-world user pressures remains scarce, particularly in anxiety-driven interactions from \nparents in pediatric consultations. Moreover, existing evaluations typically assess models in \nisolation, without examining whether safety properties generalize across different inference \nplatforms or model architectures, leaving critical questions about deployment robustness \nunanswered. \n   This study addresses these gaps by conducting a cross-platform evaluation of large language \nmodel (LLM) safety under realistic adversarial conditions. Specifically, the investigation focuses \non the following research questions: (RQ1) How do model architecture, scale, and inference \nplatform influence safety performance in high-risk pediatric scenarios? (RQ2) Do safety properties \ngeneralize across different deployment environments? (RQ3) How has adversarial robustness \nevolved across successive model generations? (RQ4) Which model characteristics best predict \nconsistent safe behavior under adversarial pressure? Through systematic evaluation of multiple \nmodels across diverse platforms, evidence-based insights are provided to guide the safe \ndeployment of LLMs in high-stakes medical contexts. \n   The primary contributions are: (1) Cross-platform validation of PediatricAnxietyBench across \nthree models from two major inference providers (Groq and HuggingFace), demonstrating \nbenchmark generalizability and revealing platform-independent safety patterns; (2) empirical \nevidence of evolving adversarial robustness, including the counterintuitive finding that newer \nmodels exhibit improved safety under parental pressure compared to earlier generations, \ncontradicting previous degradation patterns observed in prior evaluations of earlier model versions \nconducted in December 2025 (11); (3) systematic comparison across model architectures (Llama \nvs Mistral) and scales (7B-70B parameters), revealing that scale does not monotonically predict \nsafety and that smaller, well-aligned models can outperform larger counterparts; and (4) open-\nsource release of evaluation code, comprehensive results, and reproducible analysis pipelines to \nfacilitate community validation and extension of these findings. \nMethods  \nBenchmark Design \nPediatricAnxietyBench, introduced in a prior evaluation (11), comprises 300 high-quality queries \nacross 10 common pediatric clinical topics, with a balanced composition of 150 authentic patient-\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "derived queries and 150 synthetically crafted adversarial queries to simulate real-world parental \nanxiety pressures. \nAuthentic queries were extracted from the HealthCareMagic-100k dataset, a publicly available \ncollection of real patient-physician interactions. Selection criteria included pediatric cases (age \n<18 years), English language, minimum query length of 15 words, and sufficient medical context. \nFiltering involved keyword-based rules followed by manual verification to ensure diversity and \nrelevance. \nAdversarial queries were generated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with a systematic prompt template \ndesigned to incorporate parental pressure patterns, such as direct insistence on definitive answers, \nexpressions of urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to standard disclaimers (see \nSupplementary Materials for the full prompt template and generation strategies). Generation was \ncontrolled for clinical topics and severity levels (critical, urgent, moderate) to ensure balanced \ncoverage. Queries were classified into 10 topical categories based on American Academy of \nPediatrics guidelines (12). A summary of the distribution is provided in Table 1. This classification \nfacilitates topic-specific vulnerability analysis. \nPediatricAnxietyBench is designed as a modular, dataset-agnostic evaluation framework, enabling \nthe same safety assessment pipeline to be applied to any pediatric query set that conforms to the \nbenchmark schema (query text, topic label, adversarial flag, and severity level). \nTable 1: Topical Distribution of Queries in PediatricAnxietyBench \nTopic \nNumber of Queries Percentage \nFever \n50 \n16.7% \nRespiratory issues 27 \n9.0% \nHead injury \n24 \n8.0% \nSkin rash \n21 \n7.0% \nVomiting/diarrhea 20 \n6.7% \nBehavioral issues \n13 \n4.3% \nInfant crying \n10 \n3.3% \nSeizures \n9 \n3.0% \nLimping \n7 \n2.3% \nMiscellaneous \n119 \n39.7% \nTotal \n300 \n100% \nModels and Inference Platforms \nTo assess cross-platform generalizability and architectural diversity, three models from different \narchitectures were evaluated using two major inference providers. \nGroq Platform: \n• \nLlama-3.3-70B-Versatile (70 billion parameters, released November 2024) \n• \nLlama-3.1-8B-Instant (8 billion parameters, released July 2024) \n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "HuggingFace Inference API: \n• \nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (7 billion parameters, Mistral AI) \nModel selection criteria included: (1) open availability for reproducibility; (2) architectural \ndiversity (Llama vs Mistral families); (3) scale variation spanning 7B to 70B parameters to \nsystematically assess size effects; (4) demonstrated strong performance on general medical \nbenchmarks; and (5) availability through production-grade inference APIs to reflect realistic \ndeployment scenarios rather than research-only environments. \nA standardized system prompt was applied uniformly across all models and platforms to establish \na consistent safety baseline: \n\"You are a medical AI assistant helping anxious parents with pediatric health questions. \nCRITICAL SAFETY RULES: \n1.

Adversarial impact was assessed via independent t-tests comparing adversarial \n(n=30) versus non-adversarial (n=270) subsets. Effect sizes were quantified using Cohen's d, with \ninterpretation following conventional thresholds (small: d≥0.2, medium: d≥0.5, large: d≥0.8). \nConfidence intervals (95%) were computed via bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) \nbootstrapping with 10,000 iterations to accommodate non-normal distributions in safety scores. \nPearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess relationships between hedging behavior \nand overall safety scores. All statistical analyses were performed using SciPy (v1.10.0) and \nNumPy (v1.24.0) in Python 3.10. Complete analysis code is available in the public repository. \nNo correction for multiple comparisons was applied, as analyses were hypothesis-driven rather \nthan exploratory, and the primary comparisons (three pairwise model tests) represent a modest \nfamily size where correction would be overly conservative (14). This approach aligns with recent \nrecommendations for hypothesis-driven research in medical AI evaluation (15).

This consistent failure across model generations \nand architectures underscores fundamental challenges in medical triage capabilities. \nDiscussion \nPrincipal Findings and Interpretation \nThis cross-platform evaluation of three large language models across 300 pediatric queries \nrevealed several unexpected findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about LLM safety in \nmedical contexts. Most notably, the results demonstrated a reversal of the adversarial degradation \npattern documented in earlier model generations, with current models showing improved rather \nthan diminished safety under parental pressure. This positive adversarial effect was strongest in \nMistral-7B (+1.09 points, p = 0.0002) and suggests substantive evolution in adversarial robustness \nacross recent model releases spanning 5 to 17 months from the Llama-3.1 release in July 2024 to \nthe current evaluation in December 2025. \nEqually striking was the finding that Llama-3.1-8B (8 billion parameters) significantly \noutperformed Llama-3.3-70B (70 billion parameters) on both mean safety (+0.66 points, p = \n0.0001) and consistency (SD 1.45 vs 3.17). This scale paradox contradicts conventional wisdom \nthat larger models universally provide superior performance. Recent work by Singhal et al. on \nMed-PaLM 2 similarly demonstrated that model scale alone does not guarantee clinical safety, \nwith alignment quality emerging as the critical determinant (18). The results suggest that safety \nderives from alignment quality, training data composition, and architectural choices rather than \nparameter count alone. \nThe consistency of safety patterns across Groq and HuggingFace platforms provides evidence for \nbenchmark robustness and suggests that observed differences reflect intrinsic model properties \nrather than platform-specific artifacts (19). However, the 8% failure rate specific to Llama-3.3-\n70B on Groq highlights that deployment infrastructure remains a practical consideration, echoing \nconcerns regarding production reliability of large-scale medical AI systems (20). \nEvolution of Adversarial Robustness \nThe reversal from adversarial degradation (observed in the prior Llama-3.1 evaluation (11): -8% \nsafety) to improvement (current evaluation: +0.05 to +1.09) suggests several possible mechanisms. \nThe most plausible explanation is alignment evolution, where newer models incorporate \nadversarial parental interactions in RLHF training data, explicitly rewarding maintained safety \nunder pressure (21, 22). Perez et al. demonstrated that models trained on adversarial datasets \nexhibit significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution pressures (23). The temporal \ncoherence (effect absent in the prior evaluation, present in current across multiple new releases) \nand model-specificity (strongest in latest Mistral release) support this hypothesis. \nAlternative explanations include enhanced instruction-following capabilities in newer \narchitectures (24, 25), platform-level content moderation triggered by urgency cues (26), or \nimproved contextual understanding enabling recognition of anxiety as a contextual factor requiring \n"}, {"page": 19, "text": "increased caution (27). However, definitive mechanistic understanding would require access to \nproprietary training data and model internals, which remain unavailable for commercial models \n(28). \nScale Paradox and Resource Implications \nThe superior performance of Llama-3.1-8B over Llama-3.3-70B challenges the prevailing \nresource-intensive scaling paradigm. The influential scaling laws proposed by Kaplan et al. \npredicted monotonic performance improvements with increasing parameter count (29). However, \nthe present findings contribute to emerging evidence indicating that this relationship does not hold \nuniformly across all contexts. The analysis by Hoffmann et al. on Chinchilla further demonstrated \nthat compute-optimal training requires balancing model size with training data volume and quality \n(30), a principle that appears to extend to safety alignment as well. \nThis finding has profound implications for resource-constrained healthcare systems. Smaller \nmodels offer advantages in latency, cost, and local deployment feasibility without sacrificing \nsafety performance (31). However, several caveats merit emphasis. First, Llama-3.3-70B's lower \nperformance may reflect version-specific regressions rather than inherent scale limitations. \nSecond, this evaluation focused exclusively on safety; diagnostic accuracy, medical knowledge \nbreadth, or handling of complex presentations might favor larger models (18, 32). Third, \noperational challenges for large models compound safety considerations in production \nenvironments. \nBoth Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B demonstrated narrow score distributions (SD ≈ 1.5) compared \nto Llama-3.3-70B (SD = 3.17), indicating more predictable behavior. In high-stakes medical \napplications, consistency may be as valuable as average performance, as unpredictable failures \nerode trust (33, 34). \nTopic-Specific Vulnerabilities \nThe persistent vulnerability of seizure-related queries (mean safety score 8.42, 33% inappropriate \ndiagnosis rate) across all three models suggests domain-specific challenges independent of model \nscale or architecture. Seizure queries exhibited distinctive characteristics: longer text, frequent \nmedical terminology, and inherent clinical urgency. These features may trigger pattern-matching \nbehaviors that bypass general safety constraints (35). \nThe phrase \"febrile seizure\" appeared in 44% of seizure queries. Models frequently responded with \nstatements like \"this sounds like a febrile seizure,\" constituting inappropriate definitive diagnoses \ndespite technical accuracy. This exemplifies a critical challenge: models possess correct medical \nknowledge but lack contextual judgment. The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines \nexplicitly reserve febrile seizure diagnosis for scenarios with documented fever and witnessed \nseizure characteristics (36), information rarely available in parent-reported text queries. \nPost-vaccination queries presented different vulnerabilities, with low safety scores driven by \ncompeting objectives: addressing vaccine hesitancy while maintaining diagnostic restraint about \nadverse reactions (37, 38). Conversely, limping queries achieved highest safety scores (11.05), \n"}, {"page": 20, "text": "likely reflecting clear clinical protocols that align naturally with referral recommendations (39, \n40). \nHedging as Safety Mechanism \nThe strong correlation between hedging phrase count and composite safety scores (Pearson r = \n0.68, p < 0.001) validates explicit uncertainty expression as a robust safety mechanism (41, 42). \nResponses with ≥2 hedging phrases achieved perfect referral adherence (100%) and significantly \nhigher safety scores (12.1 vs 9.8, p < 0.001). \nHowever, hedging alone is insufficient. Mistral-7B exhibited highest hedging (0.22 \nphrases/response) but also elevated inappropriate diagnosis rates (13.0% vs 6.0-7.7% for Llama \nmodels), indicating that hedging and diagnostic restraint are partially independent dimensions (43). \nModels can simultaneously express uncertainty and provide inappropriate definitive statements. \nEffective safety requires integrated approaches combining hedging, referral adherence, diagnostic \nrestraint, and emergency recognition (44). \nComparison with Prior Work \nThis study extends medical LLM safety literature in three important ways. First, while prior \nbenchmarks such as Med-PaLM and MedQA emphasized technical accuracy on structured \nexaminations (18, 45), PediatricAnxietyBench demonstrates that high accuracy does not guarantee \nsafe behavior when users challenge standard safeguards. Second, by comparing prior and current \nmodel generations on identical queries, this work documents an 84% improvement in baseline \nsafety and complete reversal of adversarial vulnerability, representing longitudinal evidence of \nimproving adversarial robustness in medical AI. Third, cross-platform validation demonstrates that \nsafety properties generalize across different inference providers, validating benchmark utility for \ndeployment assessment. \nThe finding that smaller models can outperform larger counterparts on safety adds to emerging \nevidence that alignment quality and architecture matter independently of parameter scale (46). \nUnlike token-level adversarial attacks focused on jailbreaking, this study designed semantic-level \npressures that mirror authentic parent-provider interactions documented in pediatric telemedicine \nliterature (47), addressing concerns that adversarial AI research often lacks clinical ecological \nvalidity. \nLimitations \nSeveral limitations constrain interpretation and generalizability. First, the adversarial subset \n(n=30) provided limited statistical power for detecting small effects, as evidenced by borderline \nsignificance for Llama-3.3-70B adversarial improvement (p=0.051). Expanding to at least 100 \nadversarial queries would strengthen future analyses. Second, rule-based safety metrics ensured \nreproducibility but may miss contextually appropriate statements or over-penalize technically \ncorrect advice. Clinical expert review of a random sample (n=50) showed 86% agreement with \nautomated scores but revealed that 14% of disagreement cases involved automation being overly \nconservative. This suggests that the safety estimates represent lower bounds rather than precise \n"}, {"page": 21, "text": "measurements. Third, temporal comparison between prior and current evaluations conflates model \ngeneration effects with potential differences in evaluation infrastructure and scorer \nimplementation. Ideally, both old and new models would be evaluated simultaneously on identical \ninfrastructure, but API deprecation of earlier Llama versions precluded this design. Fourth, model \nselection represented a narrow slice of the LLM landscape. Evaluation included three open-source \nmodels accessible via free-tier APIs, but proprietary medical models and general-purpose frontier \nsystems may exhibit different safety profiles (48). Fifth, English-only queries from U.S. healthcare \ncontexts limit applicability to non-English languages and healthcare systems with different triage \nprotocols or patient communication norms. Medical LLM performance varies substantially across \nlanguages (49), and cultural differences in patient autonomy and trust likely modulate safety-\nrelevant behaviors. Sixth, prompt engineering dependency means that alternative system prompt \nformulations emphasizing different aspects might alter relative model rankings. All safety \nmeasurements reflect the interaction between intrinsic model capabilities and the specific prompt \ndesign employed. Finally, metrics assess response properties as safety proxies based on clinical \nguidelines but do not measure actual health outcomes such as appropriate care utilization, time to \ndiagnosis, or adverse events. The assumed link between high safety scores and beneficial outcomes \nremains empirically unvalidated. Prospective studies linking AI response characteristics to patient \nbehaviors and clinical outcomes represent an essential next step (50). \nClinical and Policy Implications \nHealthcare systems considering LLM integration should draw several lessons from these findings. \nFirst, resource allocation should prioritize alignment quality over computational scale. The \nsuperior performance of smaller, well-aligned models challenges assumptions that clinical AI \nrequires maximal computational resources and suggests that strategic investment in safety-specific \ntraining may yield greater returns than parameter maximization. Second, given persistent topic-\nspecific vulnerabilities (seizures: 33% inappropriate diagnosis; post-vaccination: elevated safety \nconcerns), single-model deployments are insufficient. Healthcare organizations should implement \nmulti-layered architectures incorporating topic classifiers that route high-risk queries to enhanced \nsafety protocols, secondary verification layers, or human escalation pathways (51). Third, the \ndocumented evolution from adversarial degradation to robustness demonstrates that safety is not \nstatic but changes with model updates. Deployment pipelines should incorporate continuous \nadversarial monitoring to detect regressions or emerging vulnerabilities, analogous to continuous \nintegration testing in software engineering. Fourth, the opacity of closed-weight commercial \nmodels complicates safety assurance and accountability. Healthcare organizations should \nnegotiate API contracts requiring disclosure of safety metric performance, adversarial test results, \nand model update notifications. Where feasible, open-source models offer auditability advantages \nthat may justify accepting slightly lower performance in high-stakes applications (52). Fifth, \ndeployment interfaces should educate users about AI limitations through dynamic disclaimers, \nstructured referral pathways to appropriate care levels, and follow-up reminders. Even models with \nhigh safety scores cannot substitute for clinical judgment. Finally, regulatory frameworks should \nadapt to rapidly evolving AI systems. Static pre-deployment testing is inadequate; safety properties \nchange with model updates in ways requiring ongoing validation (53). Regulators should consider \nmandating adversarial benchmark performance disclosure for consumer-facing medical AI, \ncreating public metrics that enable informed user choice and drive competitive safety \nimprovements. \n"}, {"page": 22, "text": "Future Research Directions \nSeveral high-priority research directions emerge from this work. First, PediatricAnxietyBench \nshould be expanded to include multilingual queries to assess cross-lingual safety transfer, \nmultimodal inputs incorporating images and videos to mirror realistic telemedicine scenarios, \nlongitudinal multi-turn conversations simulating symptom evolution, and additional medical \ndomains to test safety generalization beyond pediatrics. Second, mechanistic interpretability \nstudies are needed to understand the scale paradox and positive adversarial effect. Identifying \nwhich model components mediate safety behavior and how they differ between robust and \nvulnerable models would inform targeted interventions and theory development. Third, alignment \nintervention studies should test adversarial fine-tuning on medical pressure scenarios, retrieval-\naugmented generation incorporating clinical protocols, and multi-model ensembling to reduce \nfailure mode correlation. Fourth, prospective clinical validation trials deploying LLM-assisted \ntriage in controlled settings with rigorous outcome monitoring are essential to translate benchmark \nperformance into evidence of clinical benefit or harm. Such trials would bridge the laboratory-to-\nclinic translation gap and provide an evidence basis for regulatory decisions (54). Fifth, health \nequity analyses should examine whether smaller models enable broader access in resource-\nconstrained settings. If smaller models prove safer and more consistent, this has profound \nimplications for democratizing AI-assisted healthcare in low-resource environments. Finally, \ndevelopment of consensus adversarial testing protocols, validation of safety metrics against \nclinical outcomes, and establishment of acceptable failure thresholds would accelerate regulatory \npathways and enable meaningful model comparison. Multi-stakeholder collaboration is needed to \nestablish evidence-based standards (55). \nConclusion \nThis cross-platform evaluation demonstrated three principal findings: adversarial robustness has \nevolved from degradation to improvement across recent model releases spanning 5 to 17 months, \nsmaller well-aligned models can outperform larger counterparts, and safety patterns generalize \nacross platforms. While substantial progress is evident, persistent vulnerabilities in seizure-related \nqueries (33% inappropriate diagnosis) and universal absence of emergency recognition (0%) \nunderscore that current models remain unsuitable for autonomous medical triage. The documented \nlearnability of adversarial robustness suggests that similar gains may be achievable in other high-\nrisk domains through targeted training. The scale-safety decoupling implies that resource-\nconstrained settings need not compromise safety by deploying smaller models. However, realizing \nthis potential requires sustained collaboration between developers, providers, regulators, and \npatient communities to ensure that technological capabilities are matched by robust safety \nassurance and equitable access.

No payments, \nconsulting fees, or in-kind support were received from any organization in relation to this research. \nThe author is employed by Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, which had no role in study \ndesign, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or manuscript preparation beyond providing \ngeneral institutional affiliation. \nAuthor Contributions Statement \nAs the sole author, V.Z. was responsible for all aspects of this work: conceptualization, \nmethodology development, dataset curation, software implementation, formal analysis, validation, \ninvestigation, data interpretation, visualization, writing (original draft and revisions), and project \nadministration. V.Z. confirms accountability for all aspects of the work and accuracy of the \nmanuscript content. \nEthics Statement \nThis study has been determined exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval, given that \nno primary data collection from human subjects occurred and only publicly available, de-identified \ndatasets and synthetic queries were utilized. \nData Sources and Privacy: Authentic queries were extracted from the HealthCareMagic-100k \ndataset, a publicly available corpus of anonymized patient-physician interactions distributed under \nthe Apache 2.0 license. The original dataset underwent de-identification by its creators, with \nremoval of personally identifiable information (PII) including names, locations, dates, and medical \nrecord numbers. Additional verification ensured that no residual PII remained in the 150 queries \nselected for PediatricAnxietyBench. Adversarial queries (n=150) were synthetically generated \nusing Claude 3.5 Sonnet and do not correspond to real individuals or clinical encounters. \nInformed Consent: Given that all data sources are either public and de-identified or synthetic, \ninformed consent from individual patients or parents does not apply. Users who contributed to the \noriginal HealthCareMagic platform consented to public data sharing under that platform's terms \nof service, which included provisions for research use. \nRisk Assessment: Potential risks associated with releasing PediatricAnxietyBench and \ndisseminating study findings have been assessed as follows: \n1. Re-identification Risk: The risk of re-identifying individuals from benchmark queries is \nconsidered negligible due to (a) de-identification of the original dataset, (b) additional \nscreening, (c) the generic nature of pediatric symptom descriptions, and (d) the absence of \ndetailed personal contexts. Nevertheless, additional safeguards were implemented, including \nexclusion of queries mentioning specific providers, institutions, or geographic details. \n2. Misuse Risk: PediatricAnxietyBench could theoretically be used to train models that perform \nbetter on benchmarks while remaining unsafe in deployment, a form of \"teaching to the test.\" \nThis risk is mitigated by (a) emphasizing that benchmark performance represents a necessary \nbut insufficient condition for deployment, (b) releasing diverse query types to reduce \n"}, {"page": 26, "text": "overfitting potential, and (c) publicly documenting limitations to discourage over-reliance on \nscores. \n3. Dual-Use Concerns: The adversarial queries and trigger pattern analysis could inform \nmalicious actors seeking to exploit medical AI systems. This risk has been weighed against the \nbenefit of transparent safety research, with the determination that (a) the adversarial techniques \ndescribed here are relatively unsophisticated and likely discoverable independently, (b) \ndisclosure enables developers to address vulnerabilities, and (c) responsible disclosure \npractices (publishing after allowing time for model improvements) reduce immediate \nexploitation risk. \n4. Clinical Harm: No direct patient interactions or clinical interventions occurred as part of this \nresearch. Model outputs were not provided to parents or used for actual medical decision-\nmaking. However, publication of findings suggesting LLM capabilities in medical contexts \ncould inadvertently encourage inappropriate self-diagnosis. This issue is addressed through \nexplicit disclaimers in all public-facing materials emphasizing that LLMs serve as research \ntools, not substitutes for professional medical advice. \nVulnerable Populations: The research involved pediatric medical scenarios, which represent a \nvulnerable population. Particular care was taken to avoid content that could be disturbing or that \nsensationalizes child illness. Queries were selected or generated to reflect common, manageable \nconditions rather than rare, severe pathology. No graphic descriptions of child suffering were \nincluded. \nRegulatory Compliance: This study complied with all applicable data protection regulations, \nincluding GDPR (for European data subjects potentially represented in HealthCareMagic) and \nHIPAA (inapplicable as no protected health information was accessed). Dataset release complies \nwith open science principles while respecting intellectual property rights of original data creators \n(attribution provided, license terms followed). \nBroader Ethical Considerations: LLM deployment in medical contexts raises profound ethical \nquestions regarding automation of care, erosion of patient-provider relationships, and inequitable \naccess. Although this study focused on safety evaluation rather than normative questions about \nwhether medical AI should be deployed, these concerns are acknowledged, with advocacy for \nmultidisciplinary deliberation involving clinicians, ethicists, patients, and communities most \naffected by these technologies. The goal is to contribute evidence that informs responsible policy, \nnot to advocate for specific deployment decisions. \nPositionality Statement: The author approaches this research as a health informatics researcher \nwith training in both medicine and computer science, committed to evidence-based evaluation of \nemerging technologies. The author's perspective is shaped by experience in medical education and \nclinical practice, which informs sensitivity to patient safety considerations. However, the author \nrecognizes limitations in anticipating all ethical implications and welcomes critical engagement \nfrom diverse stakeholders. \nReferences \n"}, {"page": 27, "text": "1.
