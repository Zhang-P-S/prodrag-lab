CAPT\nsupports models with disjoint vocabularies,\nleveraging contrastive decoding to selectively\ninject clinically relevant signals while preserv-\ning the general-domain model’s reasoning and\nfluency. On six clinical classification and text-\ngeneration tasks, CAPT with a new-generation\ngeneral-domain model and an older-generation\nclinical model consistently outperforms both\nmodels individually and state-of-the-art en-\nsembling approaches (average +17.6% over\nUniTE, +41.4% over proxy tuning across tasks).\nThrough token-level analysis and physician\ncase studies, we demonstrate that CAPT am-\nplifies clinically actionable language, reduces\ncontext errors, and increases clinical specificity.\n1\nIntroduction\nDespite advances in general-domain language mod-\nels, their application to clinical settings remains\nlimited by hallucinations, omission of critical de-\ntails, and failures in clinical reasoning (Lehman\net al., 2023; Hager et al., 2024; Asgari et al., 2025).\nThese shortcomings arise because pretraining cor-\npora contain limited representations of clinical data,\nsuch as electronic health records, due to privacy\nconstraints (Singhal et al., 2023a).\nDomain adaptation techniques such as continued\npretraining and finetuning address these challenges\nbut require resource-intensive retraining for each\nnew model generation (e.g., MedPalm 1 →Med-\nPalm 2) (Singhal et al., 2023b). This creates a lag\nbetween advances in base model capabilities and\ntheir clinical applicability, with substantial compu-\ntational resources reinvested in domain adaptation\nfor each new architecture.\nWe explore model ensembling as a training-free\napproach to combine the advanced reasoning of\nstate-of-the-art general-domain models with the do-\nmain knowledge of legacy clinical models. Prior\nworks show that integrating decoding-time proba-\nbility distributions of general-domain models with\nheterogeneous architectures can yield efficient per-\nformance gains (Yao et al., 2025). However, these\napproaches assume largely overlapping model ca-\npabilities and have not been explored for combin-\ning models with distinct strengths, where infor-\nmation must be selectively integrated rather than\nuniformly aggregated. For example, we seek to\nincorporate the learned clinical knowledge of an\nolder-generation clinical model without inheriting\nits limitations in instruction following, reasoning,\nor robustness due to its architecture or catastrophic\nforgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017).\nContrastive decoding offers a mechanism for\nisolating a model’s strengths by choosing tokens\nthat maximize the likelihood difference between\nexpert and amateur models, amplifying the expert’s\nbehavior (Li et al., 2023a). Proxy tuning lever-\nages contrastive decoding to efficiently tune a large\npretrained model by combining its logit distribu-\ntion with the distributional delta between a smaller\nfine-tuned model and its untuned, base counterpart\n(Liu et al., 2024). However, proxy tuning assumes\nshared tokenization across models, restricting archi-\ntectural diversity and preventing reuse of domain-\nadapted models built on older architectures.\nHere, we propose Cross-Architecture Proxy\nTuning (CAPT), a probability-level ensembling\nmethod that supports models with disjoint vocabu-\nlaries and leverages contrastive decoding to selec-\ntively incorporate the specialized knowledge of a\ndomain-adapted model. Our contributions include:\n• We introduce CAPT which enables reuse of\nlegacy domain-adapted clinical models for\ntraining-free adaptation of newer-generation\nmodels.\nAcross six clinical classification\n1\narXiv:2601.03423v2  [cs.CL]  19 Jan 2026\n"}, {"page": 2, "text": "and text-generation benchmarks, CAPT con-\nsistently outperforms prior ensembling ap-\nproaches, with an average improvement of\n17.6% over UniTE and 41.4% over proxy tun-\ning across metrics and tasks.\n• Through a token-level analysis, we illustrate\nthat CAPT selectively integrates the clinical\nmodel’s knowledge for clinically actionable\ntokens, while the general model controls lin-\nguistic structure and formatting tokens.\n• In a physician-led case study, we demon-\nstrate that CAPT-generated outputs contain\nmore precise clinical terminology and context-\nappropriate recommendations.\n1.1\nRelated Works\nModel Ensembling. Probability-level model en-\nsembling methods for heterogeneous architectures\nhave primarily been explored with multiple general-\ndomain models (Xu et al., 2024; Huang et al.,\n2024). UNiTE, the strongest-performing method\nto date, unions each model’s top-k tokens at ev-\nery decoding step and combines probabilities via\nre-tokenization (Yao et al., 2025). Prior analyses\nshow ensembling methods only outperform the en-\nsemble’s strongest model when performance gaps\nare within 10% (Yao et al., 2025). This limits appli-\ncability when combining new- and old-generation\narchitectures where gaps can arise from architec-\ntural advances alone (Bedi et al., 2025). In con-\ntrast, CAPT is designed for models with asymmet-\nric capabilities and enables selective integration of\nlearned information from older domain models.\nContrastive Decoding. Contrastive decoding has\nbeen used to steer pretrained models toward de-\nsirable behaviors, including reduced toxicity (Liu\net al., 2021), increased helpfulness (Mitchell et al.,\n2023), selective unlearning (Suriyakumar et al.,\n2025), and improved coding, QA, and math perfor-\nmance (Liu et al., 2024). These methods require\nshared vocabularies, and are evaluated in task- or\ninstruction-tuning settings that are in-distribution\nof the large model’s training corpora. Our approach\nsupports models with disjoint vocabularies and is\nevaluated on clinical domain adaptation, a substan-\ntially out-of-distribution setting (Kim et al., 2025).\n2\nMethods\nCross-Architecture Proxy Tuning (CAPT). We\nhypothesize that general-domain models encode\nsubstantial medical knowledge but lack exposure\nto clinical practice patterns and stylistic conven-\ntions reflected in clinical notes. Accordingly, the\nnew-generation general-domain model should lead\ngeneration to preserve fluency and reasoning, while\nthe clinical model selectively interjects for tokens\nassociated with domain-specific reasoning or stylis-\ntic patterns. To achieve this, CAPT re-ranks the top-\nk candidate tokens proposed by the general-domain\nmodel using a log-probability offset defined by the\ndifference between the clinically trained model and\nits untrained base counterpart.\nFormal definition.\nLet Mnew be a new-\ngeneration general-domain language model with\ntokenizer Tnew and vocabulary Vnew. Let Mold-clin\ndenote an older-generation clinically trained model\nand Mold its untrained base counterpart; both share\ntokenizer Told and vocabulary Vold.\nGiven a context x1:t, the models define next-\ntoken log-probabilities log pnew(· | x1:t) over Vnew\nand log pold-clin(· | x1:t), log pold(· | x1:t) over\nVold. We restrict computation to the candidate set\nCt = Top-k\n\u0000log pnew(· | x1:t)\n\u0001\n⊆Vnew, the k most\nlikely next-tokens under Mnew.\nBecause the models operate over different vocab-\nularies, we define a decode–retokenize mapping\nf : Vnew →Vold that projects each candidate to-\nken from the new model into the clinical model’s\nvocabulary by decoding a token from Vnew to its\nstring form and re-tokenizing the string using Told.\nFor i ∈Ct, we define f(i) as the first non-space\ntoken in Told(decodenew(i)). For each candidate\ntoken i ∈Ct, we update its log-probability:\ns(i) = log pnew(i | x1:t) +\nα\n\u0010\nlog pold-clin(f(i) | x1:t)−log pold(f(i) | x1:t)\n\u0011\nwhich adds a correction representing the isolated\nclinical-domain signal. The selected token, i∗=\narg maxi∈Ct s(i), is appended to the context. We\nset k = 20, reflecting the top-20 log-probabilities\nexposed by black-box API providers (OpenAI,\n2025; Google DeepMind, 2025) and fix α = 1.0.\nSee Appendix B for hyperparameter analysis.\nModels and Baselines.\nWe use Qwen3-30B\n(Yang et al., 2025) as the new-generation general-\ndomain model (Mnew) and MeLLaMA-13B-chat\n(Xie et al., 2024) as the old-generation clinical\nmodel (Mold-clin). MeLLaMA-13B-chat is continu-\nally pre-trained from LLaMA-2-13B-base (Mold)\nand instruction-tuned on clinical notes and tasks.\nWe compare against proxy tuning (Liu et al.,\n2024) and UNiTE (Yao et al., 2025), the strongest\nprobability-level ensembling method to date.

Table 1 summa-\nrizes performance across classification and text\ngeneration tasks. Mnew outperforms Mold-clin by\nan average of 53.6% in Macro-F1 on classifica-\ntion benchmarks and 52.6% in LLM-jury scores\non text-generation benchmarks. This performance\ngap likely explains why UNiTE, which averages\nthe probability scores of Mold-clin and Mnew, per-\nforms worse than Mnew alone by 8–28% on av-\nerage. While proxy tuning narrows the gap be-\ntween Mold-L and Mold-clin, it is consistently outper-\nformed by Mnew, underscoring how architectural\nadvances alone can substantially improve perfor-\nmance. CAPT outperforms Mnew on 8 of 12 met-\nrics, while UniTE improves on only 2. Averaged\nacross all tasks and metrics, CAPT outperforms\nUniTE and proxy tuning by 17.6% and 41.4%, re-\nspectively. For text-generation tasks, CAPT yields\nsubstantially more risk-free outputs (+35.85% vs.\nUniTE; +63.12% vs. proxy tuning), indicating im-\nproved clinical safety alongside performance gains.\nCAPT selectively integrates clinical domain\nknowledge.\nFigure 1 summarizes mean log-\nprobability shifts by semantic token category. Pos-\nitive values indicate categories for which CAPT\nincreases token preference via the clinical-model\noffset between Mold-clin and Mold, while negative\nvalues indicate categories for which the offset de-\ncreases preference and Mnew retains stronger in-\nfluence. Mold-clin strongly influences tokens asso-\nciated with clinical decision-making (e.g., Clin-\nical Decision Action Headers, Clinical Assess-\nment Terms) and documentation style (e.g., Clini-\ncal Hedging, Condition State Descriptors). In con-\ntrast, medical knowledge categories (e.g., Diagnos-\ntics, Medical Roots) exhibit relatively small shifts,\nconsistent with CAPT primarily affecting how the\nknowledge of Mnew is expressed to match clinical\ndocumentation conventions rather than overriding\nits content. Linguistic structure and formatting\nremain dominated by Mnew (e.g., Formatting, Gen-\neral Morphemes, Medical Suffixes).\n3\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "Figure 1:\nMean log-probability offset between\nMold-clin and Mold of generated tokens by semantic\ncategory.

A physician assessed\noutputs for accuracy, appropriateness, and overall\nutility. Figure 2 shows a representative sample of\nhow CAPT’s token-level shifts improve clinical\naccuracy and specificity. For example, CAPT re-\nplaces “72” with “48” in the postoperative monitor-\ning timeline, narrowing the range from 24-72 hours\nto 24-48 hours in line with typical discharge prac-\ntices for this procedure. Similarly, Mnew recom-\nmends monitoring “cardiac” symptoms, which are\nnot relevant to a forearm graft; CAPT correctly em-\nphasizes perfusion (i.e. blood flow). CAPT also re-\nplaces Mnew’s “neuro” token, which likely implies\n“neuro check,” with “dist.” This change directs\ngeneration towards monitoring “distal limb circu-\nlation,” which encompasses relevant components\nof the neurologic assessment (e.g., sensation and\nmotor function) as well as other important checks\n(e.g., capillary refill). Finally, CAPT shifts gen-\neration toward more precise clinical terminology.\nFor example, CAPT inserts “AV” before “graft” to\nclarify the graft type and replaces “agents” with\n“analgesics” to specify pain medication rather than\nany generic medication class.\nA limitation is that CAPT can preserve over-\nPrompt\nCAPT-generated output\nFigure 2: CAPT-generated post-operative manage-\nment plan for an MTS-Procedure example involving\na forearm arteriovenous graft (connecting an artery to\na vein).

While classification\ntasks provide standardized, widely used bench-\nmarks, clinical LLMs are more often deployed in\ntext-generation tasks (Raji et al., 2025; Corpora-\ntion, 2025; Shah Lab, 2025; Small et al., 2024),\nas smaller, simpler models can already achieve\nstrong performance on basic classification tasks (Li\net al., 2023b). In our text-generation tasks, we re-\nport peer-reviewed evaluation metrics: MedHELM\nLLM-jury scores assess accuracy, clarity, and com-\npleteness against gold-standard references (Bedi\net al., 2025) and the percentage of risk-free outputs\nas determined by MedVAL, a fine-tuned clinical\nevaluation model (Aali et al., 2025). While both\nmetrics have been benchmarked against physician\nreviews, they provide limited insight into the multi-\ndimensional nature of output quality. In practice,\nwe observed that the MedHELM LLM jury rea-\nsoning for each score differed substantially from\nphysician analysis, as the LLM jury did not high-\nlight specific contextual accuracies or information.\nTo address this gap, we include token-level anal-\nyses and an expert qualitative case study.\nAs\ndemonstrated by the case study, tokens that most\nstrongly affect clinical utility are often highly\ncontext-dependent and infrequent; consequently,\nwhile token-category analyses reveal broad trends,\nclinically meaningful improvements are difficult\nto capture through aggregate quantitative analy-\nses alone. Future work should explore evaluation\nframeworks that better capture clinically meaning-\nful improvements in open-ended generation.\nInference-time costs. Although CAPT does not\nintroduce additional training costs, it increases\ninference-time computational overhead by requir-\ning forward passes through three models. In our\nexperiments, all three models were run on a sin-\ngle A100 GPU using 4-bit quantization. We did\nnot observe a significant wall-clock latency dif-\nference between Qwen3-30b alone and CAPT\n(which additionally includes MeLLaMA-13b-chat\nand LLaMA-2-13-base), but CAPT requires greater\ncomputational resources. This may be a particular\nchallenge for on-premise deployments at smaller\nhealth systems. In this study, we use MeLLaMA-\n13B models, which are the smallest models in the\nMeLLaMA family and are state-of-the-art among\nopen-source clinical language models. Exploring\nCAPT with smaller or more specialized clinical\nmodels may further improve the feasibility of this\napproach.\n6\nEthical Considerations\nOur tasks are derived from two clinical datasets:\nMIMIC (Johnson et al., 2016) and MTSamples\n(MTSamples, 2025). MIMIC is a freely available,\nde-identified dataset of patients admitted to critical\ncare units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\nMTSamples is a publicly available, de-identified\ncollection of medical transcription sample reports\ncontributed by users for reference purposes. In\nterms of data consent, MIMIC data was collected\nunder its respective IRB approval where the require-\nment for individual patient consent was waived. We\naccess MIMIC under a data use agreement. MT-\nSamples consists of voluntarily contributed data.\nNeither dataset requires Ethics Review Board ap-\nproval for secondary analysis, as we perform in this\nstudy. We do not collect any additional data for this\nstudy which would require Ethics Review Board\napproval.\nAlthough both datasets are de-identified, the risk\nof re-identification remains, meaning that private\nhealth information of an individual could be leaked.\nThis study does not uniquely increase this risk as\nwe propose a methodological innovation operating\non existing data rather than introducing new data\nor aiming to uncover sensitive aspects of data.\nReferences\nAsad Aali, Vasiliki Bikia, Maya Varma, Nicole Chiou,\nSophie Ostmeier, Arnav Singhvi, Magdalini Paschali,\nAshwin Kumar, Andrew Johnston, Karimar Amador-\nMartinez, Eduardo Juan Perez Guerrero, Paola\nNaovi Cruz Rivera, Sergios Gatidis, Christian Blueth-\ngen, Eduardo Pontes Reis, Eddy D.

Clinical models\nsuch as Gatortron, clinicalBERT, NYUTron, Me-\nLLaMA, and Clinical-T5 have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of continued pretraining on large vol-\numes of unlabeled medical text (Yang et al., 2022;\nAlsentzer et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2023; Xie et al.,\n7\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "2024; Lehman and Johnson, 2023). Following con-\ntinued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning can fur-\nther improve performance on specific clinical tasks,\ninstruction following, and alignment with human\npreferences (Han et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025;\nSinghal et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2025; Zhang\net al., 2023). While effective, these approaches\nare highly resource-intensive, especially continued\npre-training: for example, Me-LLaMA conducted\ncontinued pretraining on LLaMA-2 base models\nusing 129B tokens and 160 × 80 GB A100 GPUs.\nOur work complements these techniques by ad-\ndressing their limited transferability, as the benefits\nof such costly adaptations are typically confined to\nthe specific model on which they are performed.\nB\nHyperparameter Analysis\nTo evaluate the effect of k and α, we conducted\nexperiments on two held-out datasets. We report\nMacro-F1 on the validation split of the MedNLI\nclassification task, and MedHelm LLM-jury score\non ACI-Bench, a text-generation task of generat-\ning a structured clinical note from patient-doctor\ndialogues (Yim et al., 2023). We use ACI-Bench\nbecause MedHelm does not provide a validation\nset for its text-generation tasks and we did not want\nto reduce sample size of our tasks. Table 2 shows\nthat varying k has minimal impact on performance.\nWe select k = 20 because black-box API providers\nprovide the top-20 logprobs for each token genera-\ntion (OpenAI, 2025; Google DeepMind, 2025). We\nset α = 1.0 because it achieves best performance\non both tasks, as shown by Table 3.\nk\nMedNLI (Macro-F1)\nACI-Bench (LLM-jury score)\n5\n0.8944\n4.377\n10\n0.8944\n4.380\n15\n0.8944\n4.377\n20\n0.8992\n4.379\nTable 2: Top-k parameter experiments.\nα\nMedNLI (Macro-F1)\nACI-Bench (LLM-jury score)\n0.5\n0.8486\n4.360\n0.7\n0.8537\n4.379\n1.0\n0.8619\n4.621\nTable 3: α parameter analysis.\nC\nExperimental Setup\nFor classification tasks, we use prefix-constrained\ngeneration to constrain outputs to an explicit JSON\nschema consisting of a \"reason\" field (a free-text\nstring with a maximum length of 600 characters)\nand a \"label\" field (a string or array of strings drawn\nfrom a predefined, task-specific label set). At each\ndecoding step, the current prefix is used to deter-\nmine the set of tokens that can legally follow while\nstill permitting completion of a valid JSON object;\nall other tokens are masked out. In CAPT, the con-\nstraint is applied to the base model’s token distri-\nbution, since the base model alone determines the\ngenerated tokens. In proxy tuning and UNiTE, the\nconstraint is applied to the token candidates consid-\nered during model combination, ensuring that only\nschema-valid tokens remain eligible after score ag-\ngregation. We use constrained decoding to reflect\nrealistic deployment settings and to remove perfor-\nmance differences driven by instruction-following\nrather than underlying knowledge.\nFor text-generation tasks, we implement a cus-\ntom model client within the MedHELM evaluation\nframework (Bedi et al., 2025). We use MedHELM\nbecause it provides a standardized, reproducible,\nand peer-reviewed evaluation pipeline across clin-\nical tasks, and includes an LLM-jury metric for\ntext-generation tasks which assesses on medical\naccuracy, completeness and clarity compared to the\nreference output. Through use of MedHELM, our\nresults can be directly compared to public leader-\nboard results, and CAPT can be readily applied\nto any of the 37 MedHELM clinical classification,\ntext generation, or question-answering tasks. In\naddition, we report the percentage of responses\nthat received a Level 1 (risk-free) grade using Med-\nVAL, a physician-aligned risk grading LLM-as-a-\njudge system (levels 1–4, where level 1 is risk-free\nand level 4 represents the highest level of clinical\nrisk). This metric assesses the clinical utility of\ntext-generation outputs at scale, in addition to our\nqualitative analyses.\nTable 4 contains a description of each task and\nthe prompt used. All models were 4-bit quantized\nto fit on NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs.\nD\nToken-Level Analysis\nWe manually categorized 280 tokens of the 1,455\nthe top 25% most frequently generated tokens in\nthe MTS-Procedure task into semantic categories.\nThe remaining tokens were excluded because they\nwere ambiguous, incomplete subword fragments,\nor otherwise not semantically interpretable.

Majority of comments related to this output can be found in Section 3,\nResults. We include additional comments here. CAPT increases clinical specificity, resulting in a more clinically actionable and descriptive\nplan. CAPT heavily preferences “proph” after “Administer,” emphasizing the preventative goal of the recommended antibiotic administration.\nCAPT also replaces “institutional” with “surgical” before “protocol,” increasing specificity as typically each institution has a protocol for\neach surgery. CAPT replaces the generic “clinical exam,” which can include physical and imaging exams, with “physical exam”, which\nis more specific to the type of follow-up care the patient needs. CAPT also adds monitoring “thrill,” which is an important physical exam\nfunction indicating that the graft is functioning. CAPT also uses more clinically relevant terminology. For example, CAPT replaces “optimize”\nwith “resume” when discussing hemodialysis, which is an important distinction as it is not possible to optimize and that language is not used\nclinically. Additionally, CAPT describes a “native” graft, which is the most common and best way of performing the graft. Despite these\nimprovements, there remain limitations. For example, the plan advises \"If the patient is not yet on dialysis, initiate or resume hemodialysis\"\nand to \"Assess current dialysis adequacy,\" which does not provide any patient-specific advice and would not be useful language in a treatment\nplan. Similarly, the advice for \"strict glycemic control (if diabetic)\" and to \"Continue antihypertensive agents preferentially those safe in CKD\"\nare also not patient-specific and are far more general than would be found in a real patient treatment plan. This is likely an artifact of the task\nitself, where insufficient patient information (e.g. about prior medications or medical history) is given to provide detailed patient-specific\nadvice, though is worth noting as a weakness.\n"}, {"page": 16, "text": "gpt.accuracy.score \n4 \ngpt.accuracy.explanation \nThe response provides correct medical advice based on clinical guidelines and the patient case, including post-operative care, graft surveillance, \ndialysis management, and medication considerations.

Long-Term Management (Weeks to Months Post-Op)** \n- **Graft Surveillance:**   \n  - Schedule regular clinical and Doppler ultrasound assessments (e.g., every 1–3 months) to monitor graft function. \n  - Refer to vascular access team for ongoing monitoring and early detection of stenosis or thrombosis. \n \n- **Optimize Renal Function:**   \n  - Control blood pressure (target <130/80 mmHg) with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade (e.g., ACE inhibitor or ARB) if not contraindicated \n(e.g., hyperkalemia, bilateral renal artery stenosis). \n  - Avoid nephrotoxic agents (e.g., NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast dye when possible). \n  - Manage comorbidities: diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia. \n \n- **Vascular Access Care:**   \n  - Educate patient on self-monitoring of graft (thrill, bruit). \n  - Instruct to avoid pressure on the graft site (e.g., no blood draws, no tight clothing). \n  - Avoid using the arm for heavy lifting or intravenous access. \n \n- **Preparation for Hemodialysis:**   \n  - Ensure the revised graft matures adequately (typically 4–8 weeks). \n  - Coordinate with nephrology and dialysis team for readiness for dialysis access use. \n  - Consider pre-dialysis evaluation (e.g., access assessment, vascular mapping) if dialysis is imminent. \n \n### **3. Follow-Up Plan** \n- **Week 1:** Post-op visit to assess wound healing, graft function, and medication tolerance. \n- **Week 2–4:** Doppler ultrasound to confirm graft patency and flow. \n- **Month 2–3:** Repeat imaging and clinical evaluation; assess for maturation. \n- **Ongoing:** Monthly or bimonthly visits with nephrology and vascular access team. \n \n### **4. Patient Education** \n- Emphasize the importance of the graft for future dialysis. \n- Teach signs of graft failure (e.g., loss of thrill, swelling, pain, coolness). \n- Encourage adherence to medications, diet (low sodium, low potassium if needed), and fluid restrictions as advised. \n- Provide written instructions and contact information for urgent concerns. \n \n### **Summary:**  The patient has undergone successful surgical revision of a thrombosed AV Gore-Tex graft. The treatment plan focuses on **early \ngraft surveillance, prevention of rethrombosis, optimization of renal function, and patient education** to ensure long-term vascular access patency and \nreadiness for hemodialysis. Close collaboration between nephrology, vascular surgery, and dialysis teams is essential. \n**Prognosis:** Favorable if graft remains patent and renal function is stabilized. Risk of rethrombosis remains, so vigilant monitoring is key. \nFigure 6: Case Study 1 - Mnew Output, LLM Jury Score = 4.11.\n"}, {"page": 18, "text": "Figure 7: Case Study 2, LLM Jury Score = 4.44.

No intraoperative complications were reported. \n \n**Postoperative Treatment Plan:** \n1. **Immediate Postoperative Care (Recovery Room / PACU):** \n   - Monitor vital signs (BP, HR, RR, SpO₂, temperature) every 15–30 minutes initially, then hourly until stable. \n   - Assess level of consciousness, epidural analgesia effectiveness, and neurological status (especially for signs of epidural-related complications \nsuch as hypotension or spinal headache). \n   - Monitor for signs of hemorrhage: uterine tone, vaginal bleeding, and hemodynamic stability. Given estimated blood loss of 1000 mL, closely \nmonitor for signs of hypovolemia (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, decreased urine output). \n   - Maintain IV fluid resuscitation (e.g., normal saline or lactated Ringer’s) to support hemodynamic stability. \n   - Assess pain control and adjust epidural or systemic analgesia as needed (e.g., acetaminophen, opioids as required). \n2. **Hemodynamic and Hematologic Monitoring:** \n   - Check hemoglobin and hematocrit pre-discharge and consider repeat if clinically indicated (e.g., signs of ongoing bleeding or instability). \n   - Monitor urine output (goal >30 mL/hour) to assess renal perfusion and fluid status. \n   - Consider blood transfusion if hemoglobin drops significantly (e.g., <8 g/dL) or if signs of hemodynamic instability persist despite fluid resuscitation. \n3. **Uterine Tone and Wound Care:** \n   - Palpate the fundus regularly to ensure firm uterine tone and prevent postpartum hemorrhage. \n   - Inspect the abdominal incision for signs of infection (erythema, swelling, drainage, dehiscence). \n   - Administer prophylactic antibiotics if not already given (e.g., cefazolin, if not already administered preoperatively per protocol). \n4. **Thromboprophylaxis:** \n   - Initiate mechanical (sequential compression devices) and/or pharmacologic (e.g., low-molecular-weight heparin, if not contraindicated) \nthromboprophylaxis per hospital protocol, typically within 4–12 hours post-op, depending on bleeding risk. \n5. **Pain Management:** \n   - Continue epidural analgesia as long as safe and effective. \n   - Transition to oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or oxycodone as needed) for breakthrough pain. \n   - Avoid NSAIDs if there is concern for bleeding or renal impairment. \n6. **Early Mobilization:** \n   - Encourage ambulation as soon as stable (typically within 6–12 hours post-op) to reduce risk of DVT, promote bowel function, and improve \nrecovery. \n7. **Bowel and Bladder Function:** \n   - Monitor for return of bowel sounds and passage of flatus. \n   - Assess for urinary retention; if unable to void within 6–8 hours post-op, consider catheterization. \n8. **Breastfeeding and Newborn Care:** \n   - Facilitate early skin-to-skin contact and initiate breastfeeding as soon as the patient is stable and alert. \n   - Provide support and education on breastfeeding techniques and newborn care. \n9. **Discharge Planning (Typically 24–48 hours post-op):** \n   - Ensure patient is afebrile, ambulating, tolerating oral intake, and has adequate pain control. \n   - Assess wound healing and provide instructions for wound care (keep dry, avoid soaking, report signs of infection). \n   - Prescribe oral antibiotics if indicated (e.g., for infection prophylaxis). \n   - Schedule follow-up:   \n     - Postpartum visit at 6–8 weeks for full recovery assessment, including wound healing, mental health screening (e.g., for postpartum depression), \nand contraception counseling. \n     - Early follow-up (within 1–2 weeks) if concerns about pain, bleeding, or infection arise. \n10. **Patient Education:** \n   - Educate on warning signs requiring immediate medical attention:   \n     - Fever >38°C (100.4°F)   \n     - Heavy vaginal bleeding (soaking more than one pad per hour)   \n     - Severe abdominal pain or tenderness   \n     - Redness, swelling, or drainage from the incision   \n     - Shortness of breath, chest pain, or calf pain (possible DVT)   \n     - Signs of depression or anxiety (e.g., persistent sadness, inability to care for baby) \n \n**Conclusion:**   \nThe patient has undergone a successful primary low-transverse cesarean section with no intraoperative complications.

Immediate Post-Operative (In-Hospital) Management (ICU/Step-Down)** \n- **Hemodynamic Monitoring:** \n  - Continuous ECG, arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary artery catheter (if indicated). \n  - Target: Maintain mean arterial pressure >65 mmHg, avoid hypotension or hypertension to protect mechanical valve and grafts. \n- **Anticoagulation:** \n  - Initiate **warfarin** therapy immediately post-op (typically within 24–48 hours after surgery, once bleeding risk is low). \n  - Target INR: **2.5–3.5** (mechanical valve standard). \n  - Monitor closely; adjust dose based on INR results. \n  - Consider bridging with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) if needed (e.g., if INR not stable). \n- **Infection Prophylaxis:** \n  - Continue IV antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin) for 24–48 hours post-op. \n  - Prophylactic antifungal therapy if high risk (e.g., prolonged ICU stay, diabetes, obesity). \n- **Pain Management:** \n  - Multimodal analgesia: Acetaminophen, regional nerve blocks (if available), and low-dose opioids as needed. \n  - Avoid NSAIDs (due to bleeding risk and renal concerns). \n- **Respiratory Support:** \n  - Early extubation when stable; encourage deep breathing, incentive spirometry, and early mobilization. \n  - Treat atelectasis or pneumonia with bronchodilators, chest physiotherapy, and antibiotics if infection suspected. \n- **Renal Protection:** \n  - Monitor urine output and serum creatinine. \n  - Avoid nephrotoxic agents (e.g., NSAIDs, aminoglycosides). \n  - Maintain euvolemia; avoid fluid overload (especially in CHF). \n- **Electrolyte & Metabolic Management:** \n  - Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia (common post-op). \n  - Tight glucose control: Insulin infusion or sliding scale insulin to maintain blood glucose **<180 mg/dL** (target 140–180 mg/dL). \n  - Monitor for post-op hyperglycemia (common in diabetics after surgery). \n \n#### **2. Cardiac Rehabilitation & Long-Term Medical Therapy** \n- **Secondary Prevention (AHA/ACC Guidelines):** \n  - **Antiplatelet Therapy:** Aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely (in addition to warfarin for mechanical valve). \n  - **Statin Therapy:** High-intensity statin (e.g., atorvastatin 40–80 mg daily) to reduce graft and valve-related atherosclerosis. \n  - **Beta-Blocker:** Start at low dose (e.g., metoprolol succinate 12.5 mg daily), titrate to target heart rate (55–65 bpm) and blood pressure. Improves survival, reduces arrhythmias, and helps \nwith CHF. \n  - **ACE Inhibitor or ARB:** If ejection fraction <50% or persistent CHF symptoms (e.g., enalapril or lisinopril). Improves remodeling and survival in post-CABG patients. \n  - **Diuretics:** If volume overload (e.g., furosemide 20–40 mg daily), titrate to symptom control and avoid dehydration. \n- **Diabetes Management:** \n  - Intensify glycemic control with insulin or oral agents (e.g., metformin if renal function allows). \n  - Target HbA1c: **<7%** (individualized based on comorbidities and risk of hypoglycemia). \n  - Educate on foot care, diet, and glucose monitoring. \n- **Weight Management & Lifestyle Modification:** \n  - Refer to **cardiac rehabilitation program** (post-op, once stable). \n  - Multidisciplinary team: Dietitian (low-sodium, heart-healthy diet), physical therapist, behavioral health. \n  - Weight loss goals: 5–10% body weight reduction over 6–12 months. \n  - Smoking cessation (if applicable). \n- **Lifestyle & Risk Factor Control:** \n  - Control hypertension (target <130/80 mmHg). \n  - Encourage regular physical activity (as tolerated). \n  - Limit alcohol intake. \n \n#### **3. Follow-Up & Surveillance** \n- **Cardiology Follow-Up:** \n  - 1–2 weeks post-op: Assess wound healing, INR, valve function, graft patency, and medication tolerance. \n  - 3 months: Echocardiogram to evaluate mechanical valve function and LV function. \n  - 6 months: Repeat echocardiogram, assess graft patency (if indicated), and review INR control. \n- **Imaging:** \n  - Consider CT angiography or stress testing at 6–12 months if symptoms recur or graft patency is in question. \n- **Anticoagulation Monitoring:** \n  - INR checks every 1–2 weeks initially, then monthly once stable. \n  - Educate patient on signs of bleeding (e.g., bruising, hematuria, melena) and clotting (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath). \n- **Patient Education:** \n  - Emphasize lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin. \n  - Teach about signs of valve thrombosis or embolism (e.g., sudden weakness, vision changes, chest pain). \n  - Provide emergency contact information and anticoagulation clinic referral. \n \n### **Summary of Key Goals:** \n- Prevent mechanical valve thrombosis and prosthetic valve endocarditis. \n- Optimize graft patency (especially LIMA to LAD, known for excellent long-term patency). \n- Control heart failure symptoms. \n- Achieve tight glycemic and lipid control. \n- Promote long-term survival and quality of life. \n \n**Conclusion:**  This patient has undergone high-risk but life-saving surgery. The treatment plan must be comprehensive, focusing on anticoagulation, metabolic control, cardiac rehabilitation, \nand long-term risk factor modification. A multidisciplinary team approach—including cardiology, endocrinology, nutrition, physical therapy, and pharmacy—is essential for optimal outcomes. \nFigure 15: Case Study 4 - Mnew Output, LLM Jury Score = 4.11.\n"}, {"page": 27, "text": "Figure 16: Case Study 5, LLM Jury Score = 4. CAPT increases specificity and accuracy. CAPT adds “bilateral” and changes “lymph node”\nto “lymph nodes,” which is more precise phrasing given that the procedure involved bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. For close monitoring,\nCAPT also changes from “late radiation” to “late complications,” which is the accurate wording for this context. CAPT replaces “pall” with\n“plastic”; this was likely the beginning of “palliative,” which is less appropriate because plastic surgery is a likely next step after this procedure.\nCAPT changes “including inspection” to be more specific: “including vaginal and inguinal region assessment.” CAPT replaces “manage\nlymphedema prophylaxis” with “prophylactically with compression garments and education,” which is more correct as one wouldn’t manage\nlymphedema prophylaxis.

She has undergone a **radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal \nlymphadenectomy (superficial and deep)**. The postoperative diagnosis confirms Stage III disease. \n \n### **1. Postoperative Pathology Review (Critical Next Step)** \n- **Obtain definitive pathology report** from the surgical specimens (radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes). \n- Determine: \n  - **Lymph node involvement (N status):** If positive nodes are identified, the stage will be upgraded to **Stage III (N1)** or **Stage IV (N2)**. \n  - **Tumor margins:** Assess for positive surgical margins (e.g., close or positive margins increase risk of local recurrence). \n  - **Depth of invasion, tumor size, and histologic grade.** \n  - **Presence of lymphovascular invasion.** \n> *Note: The preoperative clinical stage was T3/Nx/Mx; definitive N status will be determined by pathology.* \n### **2. Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Review** \n- Involve a **gynecologic oncology team**, including: \n  - Gynecologic oncologist \n  - Radiation oncologist \n  - Medical oncologist \n  - Pathologist \n  - Radiologist \n- Review pathology, surgical findings, and imaging (if available) to finalize staging and treatment plan. \n### **3. Adjuvant Therapy Based on Pathology Findings** \n#### **A. If Lymph Nodes Are Positive (N1/N2) or Margins Are Positive:** \n- **Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (RT):** \n  - **Indication:** High risk of local and regional recurrence. \n  - **Recommended regimen:**  \n    - **Pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)** to the vulvar bed and inguinal regions. \n    - **Boost to the inguinal nodes** if positive nodes were found. \n    - **Dose:** Typically 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions to the vulvar bed and inguinal nodes. \n    - **Concurrent chemotherapy (chemoradiation):** \n      - **Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin 40 mg/m² weekly)** is standard for high-risk vulvar cancer. \n      - Evidence supports improved survival and local control in node-positive or margin-positive cases. \n> *Rationale:* Given the patient’s history of prior pelvic radiation, **caution is required** in delivering additional radiation. However, **re-irradiation may be considered if \nthe risk of recurrence outweighs the risk of toxicity**, especially if the prior radiation was many years ago and the current tumor is high-risk. Dose constraints and normal \ntissue tolerance (e.g., bladder, rectum, skin) must be carefully evaluated. \n#### **B. If Lymph Nodes Are Negative (N0) and Margins Are Negative:** \n- **Close surveillance with imaging and clinical exams** may be appropriate. \n- **Consider adjuvant radiation only if other high-risk features are present** (e.g., deep invasion >5 mm, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion). \n- **Avoid radiation if possible** due to prior pelvic radiation and risk of severe late toxicity (e.g., fibrosis, ulceration, fistula, bowel obstruction). \n### **4. Systemic Therapy (Consideration)** \n- **Adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., carboplatin/paclitaxel or cisplatin/5-FU)** may be considered in high-risk cases (e.g., positive nodes, close margins, high-grade tumor), \nespecially if chemoradiation is not feasible due to prior radiation. \n- **Clinical trials** evaluating novel agents (e.g., immunotherapy) may be appropriate for recurrent or high-risk disease, though not standard in the adjuvant setting at this \ntime. \n### **5. Supportive Care and Follow-Up** \n- **Wound care and monitoring for complications** (e.g., infection, lymphedema, wound dehiscence). \n- **Lymphedema prevention and management:** Referral to a lymphedema specialist; compression garments if needed. \n- **Psychosocial support:** Counseling for body image, sexual health, and fertility concerns (if applicable). \n- **Sexual rehabilitation:** Referral to a sexual health specialist or gynecologic oncology nurse. \n- **Follow-up schedule:** \n  - Every 3–6 months for the first 2 years. \n  - Then every 6–12 months. \n  - Include physical exam, imaging (e.g., CT or PET-CT if recurrence suspected), and assessment of symptoms. \n### **6. Special Considerations** \n- **Prior pelvic radiation:** Increases risk of complications (e.g., poor wound healing, radiation proctitis, fibrosis). This must be factored into decisions about adjuvant \ntherapy. \n- **Re-irradiation:** May be considered in select cases with positive nodes and no contraindications, but with **extreme caution and dose optimization**. \n- **Multidisciplinary decision-making is essential** to balance efficacy and toxicity. \n### **Final Treatment Plan (Summary):** \n \n| **Condition** | **Recommended Action** | \n|---------------|------------------------| \n| **Positive lymph nodes or positive margins** | **Adjuvant chemoradiation:** Weekly cisplatin + pelvic/inguinal EBRT (45–50.4 Gy), with caution due to prior radiation. | \n| **Negative lymph nodes and clear margins** | **Close surveillance**; consider radiation only if other high-risk features present. Avoid radiation if possible. | \n| **All patients** | **Multidisciplinary review, psychosocial support, lymphedema screening, sexual health counseling, and regular follow-up.** | \n \n> **Note:** The final decision must be individualized based on definitive pathology and patient comorbidities. A **gynecologic oncologist should lead the care plan.** \n \n*This plan aligns with NCCN Guidelines for Vulvar Cancer (v2.2024), which recommend adjuvant therapy for Stage III disease, especially with nodal involvement or \npositive margins.* \n \nFigure 18: Case Study 5 - Mnew Output, LLM Jury Score = 4.44.\n"}]}
