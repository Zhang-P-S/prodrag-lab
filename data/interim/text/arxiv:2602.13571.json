Introduction\nIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing\n(NLP). They excel in tasks such as text generation and question answering. Leveraging their advanced capabilities in\nlanguage understanding and generation, LLMs have significantly enhanced task efficiency and user experience across a\nwide range of applications (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).

This issue poses a significant barrier\nin knowledge-intensive applications, such as medical diagnosis, where factual accuracy is paramount (Ji et al., 2023;\nHuang et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2026; Płonka et al., 2025; Chi et al., 2026; L. Li et al., 2025).\nTo mitigate hallucination, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach. By\nintegrating external knowledge retrieval with the generation process, RAG provides LLMs with a factual foundation.\nThis improves the accuracy of generated outputs (Lewis et al., 2020; W. Yu, 2022; Yao et al., 2026; T. Ren et al., 2025).\nHallucinations often stem from low confidence in internal knowledge, which can be addressed by external documents\nthat boost model confidence. Nevertheless, the success of RAG hinges on the relevance of retrieved documents. Poorly\nranked documents undermine the quality of subsequent generation. This limits the framework’s effectiveness (Liu et\nal., 2024).\nReranking has gained prominence as a vital step in enhancing retrieval outcomes within RAG systems. By\nreordering initially retrieved documents, reranking techniques improve document relevance and provide higher-\nquality inputs for generation (Y. Yu et al., 2024; Salemi & Zamani, 2024; S. Xu et al., 2024; R. Ren, Ma, &\nZheng, 2025). Although existing reranking methods have advanced retrieval performance, they encounter notable\nlimitations. Many depend on proprietary models trained on specific datasets, leading to poor generalization across\ndomains and high computational costs (Ma et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; X. Wang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024)—\nconstraints that severely restrict their practical applicability. In contrast, pre-trained LLM-based rerankers provide\nstrong generalization and no additional training costs compared to trained models; however, existing LLM-based\nrerankers primarily assess query-document relevance but underutilize LLMs’ strengths in semantic understanding,\nparticularly by overlooking confidence signals from generation processes. Furthermore, even state-of-the-art rerankers\ndemonstrate suboptimal performance, with their Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) scores often falling\nbelow 0.8 on benchmarks like BEIR (Ehsan et al., 2024).

Uncertainty Quantification Methods for LLMs\nUncertainty quantification methods can be categorized into two main types depending on whether model training is\nnecessary: training-required methods and training-free methods. Training-required methods improve the uncertainty\nexpression capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by employing fine-tuning or other learning processes. In\ncontrast, training-free methods directly leverage the model’s pre-existing capabilities to extract uncertainty information.\n2.1.1. Training-Required Methods\nTraining-required methods improve LLMs’ ability to accurately express uncertainty through model adjustment or\noptimization, primarily following three technical approaches:\nSupervised Fine-tuning Supervised fine-tuning aims to enhance LLMs’ uncertainty expression through training. For\nexample, Lin et al. (2022) enabled models to express uncertainty in natural language via fine-tuning. A key development\nis the P(IK) method, proposed by Kadavath et al. (2022), which quantifies uncertainty by training language models to\npredict their own probability of correctly answering questions. To enhance the model’s transparency and explainability\nregarding uncertainty, Y. Yang et al. (2024) further explored the possibility of embedding explicit confidence in\nthe model’s output. This was achieved by training the model to use language such as “I’m absolutely certain” or\nexpress numerical confidence (e.g., “about 90% confident”), allowing this confidence to be explicitly presented to the\nuser. In subsequent research, scholars began to focus on whether the decisiveness of language in model generations\nfaithfully reflects their intrinsic confidence. Yona et al. (2024) formalized faithful response uncertainty based on the gap\nbetween linguistic decisiveness and intrinsic confidence, evaluating models’ ability to faithfully express uncertainty in\nwords.Manggala et al. (2025) systematically explores the discrepancy between confidence scores and actual accuracy,\nproposing QA-calibration as a generalized, principled calibration notion, which provides a reference direction for\nimproving uncertainty expression in generative QA.\nReinforcement Learning ​This task is implemented by training LLMs with reinforcement learning to identify and\ndecline unknown questions. For instance, T. Xu et al. (2024) present the SaySelf training framework, which enhances\nthe model’s ability to express fine-grained confidence estimates by generating self-reflective rationales. Similarly,\nto enable models to express uncertainty in natural language when beyond their knowledge boundaries, Cheng et al.\n(2024) constructed the “I don’t know” (Idk) dataset, and achieved this through alignment training. H. Xu et al. (2024)\nproposed the Reinforcement Learning with Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) method, helping models identify knowledge\nboundaries and reject out-of-scope questions, thereby implicitly quantifying uncertainty and improving reliability. To\nidentify and address the systematic bias in reward models towards high confidence scores in RLHF training, Leng et\nal. (2025) proposed calibrated reward methods such as PPO-M and PPO-C, thereby effectively reducing calibration\nerror in LLMs.\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 3 of 21\n"}, {"page": 4, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nProbing Probing methods quantify uncertainty by analyzing internal model representations. For example, Azaria &\nMitchell (2023) introduced the SAPLMA method, which predicts statement truth probabilities by analyzing hidden\nlayer activations, providing a quantitative approach to assess LLMs’ internal confidence. Marks & Tegmark (2024)\nproposed mass-mean probing to identify and intervene in linear representations of factual truth within models, opening\nnew avenues for quantifying confidence in factual claims.\n2.1.2. Training-Free Methods\nTraining-free methods estimate uncertainty without additional optimization, leveraging existing model outputs or\nbehaviors through two main approaches:\nPrediction Probability These methods estimate uncertainty by analyzing output probability distributions. A com-\nmon method for measuring uncertainty is Predictive Entropy (Settles & Craven, 2008). To enable comparison across\ndifferent length outputs, Malinin & Gales (2021) systematically applied length-normalization to various information-\ntheoretic uncertainty measures, enhancing their practical utility. Xiao & Wang (2021) further applied entropy values to\nthe hallucination problem in conditional language generation tasks, revealing the key relationship between uncertainty\nand hallucination. One method is to prompt the extraction of uncertainty information through specially designed\ninputs. The P(True) method (Kadavath et al., 2022), for example, asks models to evaluate the probability of their\nanswers being correct, with higher probabilities indicating lower uncertainty. This approach relies on models’ self-\nassessment capabilities. Addressing the “generative inequality” problem in LLMs free-form output, where irrelevant\ntokens and sentences are over-valued when estimating uncertainty, Duan et al. (2024) proposed Shifting Attention to\nRelevance (SAR), a method that mitigates these biases by reassigning attention based on the jointly examined relevance\nof components during uncertainty quantification. To address the bias of Predictive Entropy when handling irrelevant\ninformation, Z. Wang et al. (2025) proposed Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE). WSE enhances the accuracy and stability\nof uncertainty quantification by incorporating semantic relevance at both word and sequence levels, utilizing off-\nthe-shelf LLMs and multi-sample generation. This approach also significantly improves LLMs’ accuracy in medical\nquestion-answering applications.\nSampling & Aggregation These methods estimate uncertainty by generating and analyzing multiple outputs. For\nexample,Farquhar et al. (2024) introduced Semantic Entropy to quantify uncertainty in generation tasks by considering\nsemantic equivalence.To address the insufficiency and unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric, particularly under\ndistribution shifts and biased scenarios, Lee et al. (2024) introduced the Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD)\nas a newly proposed confidence metric, allowing it to identify more reliable samples by leveraging information that\nentropy cannot capture.Meanwhile, Xiong et al. (2024) further systematically proposed a general black-box confidence\nelicitation framework, combining human-inspired prompting strategies, diverse sampling methods, and confidence\naggregation mechanisms, which can significantly improve LLMs’ performance in tasks like confidence calibration\nand failure prediction, even without internal access. Aichberger et al. (2025) introduced the Semantically Diverse\nLanguage Generation (SDLG) method, which steers LLMs to generate semantically diverse yet likely alternative texts,\nsignificantly improving the estimation accuracy of predictive uncertainty. Qing et al. (2025) evaluated consistency-\nbased metrics for post-hoc uncertainty quantification.\n2.2. Reranking Methods in RAG\nInitial retrieval in RAG still struggles with issues like irrelevant or suboptimal results, missing key documents, and\ndata quality concerns—highlighting the importance of reranking optimization. These reranking methods fall into three\ncategories: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise.\n2.2.1. Pointwise Methods\nPointwise reranking ranks documents or items by independently scoring their relevance and sorting them. Sachan\net al. (2022) achieved unsupervised Top-20 accuracy improvements on BEIR benchmarks via pre-trained model-based\nprobabilistic inference, which established zero-shot probabilistic ranking paradigms. Bonifacio et al. (2022) leveraged\nfew-shot generation capabilities to build synthetic query-document pairs via monoT5. Boytsov et al. (2024) extended\nthis to industrial-grade InPars-Light through model compression and toolchain integration.\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 4 of 21\n"}, {"page": 5, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\n2.2.2. Pairwise Methods\nPairwise reranking predicts the relative order of document pairs to achieve overall document ranking. Its advantage\nlies in closely aligning with ranking’s core by focusing on relative document order, effectively minimizing inversions\n(Joachims, 2002). Recent progress addresses computational bottlenecks and probabilistic modeling. Khattab & Zaharia\n(2020) improved efficiency via precomputed BERT document representations and late interaction. To address the order\nsensitivity of traditional methods, Jian et al. (2024) introduced the PRP-Graph framework, integrating probabilistic\nrelevance propagation, dynamic graph aggregation, and weighted PageRank to enhance ranking model stability.\nSimilarly, R. Li et al. (2024) proposed the PRD framework, introducing dynamic weighting mechanisms and multi-\nturn discussion strategies, which effectively mitigated the limitations of single-model evaluation and enhanced the\nadaptability and robustness of ranking systems. As generative retrieval (GR) develops, researchers began considering\nhow to extend it to accommodate multi-graded relevance scenarios. In this context, Tang et al. (2024a) introduced\na multi-graded constrained contrastive (MGCC) loss which incorporates grade penalty and constraint mechanisms.\nConcurrently, Maximilian et al. (2025) defined pairwise preferences based on the similarity between argumentative\nunits and the query, aggregated these preference signals in the reranking phase, significantly enhancing argument\nretrieval effectiveness. Addressing the effectiveness-efficiency trade-off optimization for retrieval using multiple\nprediction models, Harrie et al. (2025) introduced compound retrieval systems. These systems, via a selection policy,\nlearn to acquire BM25 and LLM pointwise and pairwise predictions and aggregate them for final ranking construction,\nenhancing retrieval efficiency.\n2.2.3. Listwise Methods\nListwise reranking optimizes the entire document lists to enhance retrieval effectiveness. To account for varying\nnumbers of document pairs per query and more accurately capture ranking metrics, Cao et al. (2007) proposed the\nlistwise learning-to-rank approach. This approach uses document lists as instances in learning, contrasting with the\npairwise approach which uses document pairs. By assigning different weights to training instances during optimization,\nListMAP significantly improved document ranking effectiveness (Keshvari et al., 2022). To address issues like the\ndiscrepancy between LLM pre-training objectives and the ranking objective and the lack of direct passage ranking\ncapability, Sun et al. (2023) proposed the instructional permutation generation approach to directly output passage\nrankings. They then leveraged the permutation outputs generated by ChatGPT through a permutation distillation\ntechnique to transfer its ranking capability to smaller, efficient specialized models, which significantly improved\npassage re-ranking performance. Furthermore, research has advanced in incorporating listwise principles into the\nGR paradigm. Tang et al. (2024b) proposed ListGR, which views the retrieval task as a sequential learning process\nfor generating a list of docids. Considering the sensitivity of LLMs to the order of input passages, Zhang et al.\n(2024) proposed a simple listwise sampling approach that effectively mitigates dependence on the position of ground\ntruth evidence by shuffling the list of input passages multiple times and aggregating results. Efficiency was further\naddressed by Chen et al. (2025), who implemented tournament-style dynamic grouping in their TourRank system.\nFurthermore, Suresh et al. (2025) curated CORNSTACK—a high-quality dataset filtered by dual consistency—for\ncontrastive training, yielding significant performance gains in embedding models and code rerankers on code retrieval\ntasks. Subsequently, Qi et al. (2025) proposes a label formulation integrating content-based relevance and engagement-\nbased relevance, leveraging sigmoid transformations to enhance the ranking system’s ability to differentiate content\nquality and improve controllability in ranking. Chowdhury et al. (2025) developed RankSHAP, a Shapley value-based\nfeature attribution method, to improve ranking model explainability. It significantly enhances feature attribution fidelity\nand explainability for information retrieval reranking models. Furthermore , R. Ren, Wang, et al. (2025) proposed the\nSCaLR method, which introduces explicit list-view relevance scores for global ranking and uses self-generated point-\nview relevance assessments to calibrate the list-view relevance, enhancing global comparability on large candidate\nsets.\n3. Methodology\nThis section delineates the proposed LLM-Confidence Reranker algorithm. We first elaborate on the Maximum\nSemantic Cluster Proportion, a confidence modeling technique tailored for black-box large language models (LLMs),\nas detailed in §3.1, with an emphasis on a semantic consistency approach. Subsequently, we outline the comprehensive\nprocedure of the LCR algorithm in §3.2.\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 5 of 21\n"}, {"page": 6, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\n3.1. Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion\nConfidence represents a language model’s assurance in its generated output, whereas uncertainty reflects the lack\nof such assurance. To quantify confidence in black-box LLMs, we employ a method based on semantic consistency\nassessment. Drawing inspiration from Semantic Entropy (SE) (Farquhar et al., 2024), which measures uncertainty via\nthe entropy of semantically clustered outputs, we introduce the Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP) as\na straightforward and efficient confidence metric for black-box LLMs. This metric leverages the inherent semantic\ncomprehension of LLMs to evaluate agreement across multiple generated outputs, serving as a reliable indicator of\nrelevance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\nLet 𝜙denote the parameters of a pre-trained LLM, treated as a black-box system accessible solely through input-\noutput interactions. For a given input 𝑥(e.g., a query or query-document pair), the LLM 𝜙produces outputs by sampling\nfrom its predictive distribution. To assess confidence, we apply multinomial sampling at temperature 𝑇= 1 to generate\n𝐾independent output sequences, denoted as {𝑡𝑘}𝐾\n𝑘=1, where each 𝑡𝑘is autoregressively sampled as follows:\n𝑡𝑘∼𝑝𝜙(⋅∣𝑥),\nwith 𝑝𝜙(𝑡∣𝑥) representing the probability distribution over sequences induced by the LLM 𝜙.\nThese 𝐾sequences are clustered according to semantic equivalence, forming a partition of semantically similar\noutputs. Clustering utilizes the same LLM 𝜙to assess pairwise semantic relations, ensuring alignment within the\nmodel’s semantic space without external dependencies. For each pair of sequences (𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗) where 𝑖≠𝑗, 𝑡𝑖∼𝑝𝜙(⋅∣𝑥),\nand 𝑡𝑗∼𝑝𝜙(⋅∣𝑥), we prompt the LLM 𝜙with a natural language inference (NLI)-style query to classify their semantic\nrelation. This is formalized by a function 𝑓𝜙(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗) that outputs one of: “entailment”, “contradiction”, or “neutral”,\nindicating whether 𝑡𝑖semantically entails 𝑡𝑗.\nThis pairwise assessment constructs an undirected similarity graph 𝐺= (𝑉, 𝐸), where the vertices 𝑉= {𝑡𝑘}𝐾\n𝑘=1\ncomprise the sampled sequences, and an edge (𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗) ∈𝐸exists if and only if bidirectional entailment holds:\n(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗) ∈𝐸⟺𝑓𝜙(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡𝑗) = “entailment” ∧𝑓𝜙(𝑡𝑗, 𝑡𝑖) = “entailment”.\nThe connected subgraphs in graph 𝐺are defined as node subsets where a path—a sequence of edges—exists\nbetween every pair of nodes, and no additional nodes can be included while preserving this connectivity. Such maximal\nsubgraphs form the connected components of 𝐺, partitioning the graph into disjoint sets that represent distinct semantic\nequivalence classes. These classes aggregate responses sharing the same underlying meaning, with bidirectional\nentailment ensuring transitivity and symmetry within each component, thus propagating equivalence across connected\nnodes.\nDirect computation of these connected components via a complete graph and standard algorithms (e.g., depth-first\nsearch or union-find) can be computationally demanding for large 𝐾, requiring (𝐾2) pairwise entailment evaluations.\nTo address this, we adopt a greedy clustering algorithm that approximates the graph structure without materializing\nall edges. The algorithm initializes an empty cluster set 𝑆= ∅. For each sample 𝑡𝑖(processed sequentially from 𝑖= 1\nto 𝐾):\n• Assess whether 𝑡𝑖can be assigned to an existing cluster 𝑠∈𝑆. For each such cluster 𝑠, select a representative\nresponse 𝑡(𝑠) from 𝑠, such as the initial sample added or an embedding-derived centroid for efficiency.\n• If 𝑓𝜙(𝑡𝑖, 𝑡(𝑠)) = “entailment” ∧𝑓𝜙(𝑡(𝑠), 𝑡𝑖) = “entailment”, incorporate 𝑡𝑖into 𝑠.\n• If 𝑡𝑖aligns with no existing cluster, initialize a new cluster {𝑡𝑖} and append it to 𝑆.\nThis greedy approach efficiently identifies connected components by iteratively merging samples based on\nentailment links, ensuring each resulting cluster corresponds to a maximal connected subgraph where all responses\nare semantically equivalent via transitive entailment paths. The algorithm reduces NLI evaluations (via LLM 𝜙) to\n(𝐾⋅𝑀), where 𝑀is the number of clusters (typically much smaller than 𝐾), rendering it suitable for practical\ndeployment. The final semantic equivalence classes are {𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝑀}, with 𝑀denoting the number of distinct\nmeanings identified, and cluster sizes satisfying ∑𝑀\n𝑚=1 |𝑠𝑚| = 𝐾, as each sample is assigned to exactly one class.\nFollowing cluster formation, MSCP is formally defined as:\n𝐶(𝑥) = MSCP(𝑥; 𝜙, 𝐾) =\nmax\n𝑚=1,…,𝑀\n|𝑠𝑚|\n𝐾,\n(1)\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 6 of 21\n"}, {"page": 7, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nwhere |𝑠𝑚| is the cardinality of the 𝑚-th cluster.\nThis metric quantifies confidence as the proportion of samples in the largest semantic cluster, with values near 1\nindicating high semantic consistency and elevated confidence, and lower values reflecting greater dispersion across\nclusters, signifying uncertainty. Compared to SE, which computes entropy over all cluster proportions and may be\nsensitive to minor distributional variations, MSCP offers a more direct and interpretable measure by focusing solely\non the dominant semantic mode. This simplicity facilitates faster computation and aligns well with reranking objectives\nin RAG systems, where prioritizing documents that elicit strongly consistent responses is essential.\nBy employing the same LLM for sampling and clustering, MSCP ensures internal consistency, reducing discrep-\nancies from model mismatches and enhancing its utility in black-box scenarios.

Through clustering, three semantic clusters are derived, with the largest semantic\ncluster being “Trump”, which accounts for 3∕5 of the responses, denoted as MSCP(𝑞; 𝜙, 𝐾) = 3∕5. When we provide both\nthe question 𝑞and the document 𝑑1, which states, “Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. President on Jan. 20. 2025”,\nall five sampled responses consistently point to “Trump”, resulting in MSCP(𝑞, 𝑑1; 𝜙, 𝐾) = 5∕5. Compared to the scenario\nwhere only 𝑞is provided, the MSCP increases, indicating that 𝑑1 is a helpful document for 𝑞. In contrast, when we supply\nboth the question 𝑞and the document 𝑑2, which claims, “Elon Musk becomes the 47th President of the United States”,\nthe largest semantic cluster after sampling and clustering only constitutes 2∕5, denoted as MSCP(𝑞, 𝑑2; 𝜙, 𝐾) = 2∕5. This\nrepresents a decrease in MSCP compared to when only 𝑞is provided, suggesting that 𝑑2 is a harmful document for 𝑞.\n3.2. LLM-Confidence Reranker Algorithm\nThe LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR) algorithm enhances document ranking via confidence interval binning\nand multi-level sorting. It defines a query confidence threshold 𝑇query, a high confidence threshold 𝑇upper, and a low\nconfidence threshold 𝑇lower, with its core process detailed in Algorithm 1 and Figure 1. In the algorithm, confidence for\ndocuments and queries is denoted by 𝐶(⋅), prior relevance scores (e.g., from a retriever or reranker) by 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(⋅),\nand the document set by = {𝑑𝑖}𝑛\n𝑖=1.\nThe algorithm operates through two integrated stages:\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 7 of 21\n"}, {"page": 8, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nAlgorithm 1 The LLM-Confidence Reranker Algorithm\n1: function BINNEDCONFIDENCESCORE(𝑞, 𝑑)\n2:\nif 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) ≥𝑇upper then\n3:\nreturn 1\n⊳High confidence bin\n4:\nelse if 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) ≤𝑇lower then\n5:\nreturn -1\n⊳Low confidence bin\n6:\nelse\n7:\nreturn 0\n⊳Medium confidence bin\n8:\nend if\n9: end function\n10: function LCR_SORT(𝑞, )\n11:\nGenerate joint features {(𝑞, 𝑑)}𝑑∈\n12:\nif 𝐶(𝑞) < 𝑇query then\n13:\n′ ←StableSort(, [𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑑𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑞, 𝑑) ↓, 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑞, 𝑑) ↓])\n14:\nelse\n15:\n′ ←Sort(, 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑞, 𝑑) ↓)\n16:\nend if\n17:\nreturn ′\n18: end function\n1. Confidence Assessment and Binning: It first computes the query confidence 𝐶(𝑞) and compares it to 𝑇query.\nConcurrently, it calculates joint confidence scores 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) for each document 𝑑in . Documents are then\ncategorized into three bins using 𝑇upper and 𝑇lower:\n• High confidence: if 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) ≥𝑇upper\n• Medium confidence: if 𝑇lower < 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) < 𝑇upper\n• Low confidence: if 𝐶(𝑞, 𝑑) ≤𝑇lower\n2. Ranking Strategy: If 𝐶(𝑞) < 𝑇query (low confidence), documents are sorted first by confidence bins in\ndescending order (high →medium →low), then by 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑞, 𝑑) within each bin. If 𝐶(𝑞) ≥𝑇query (high\nconfidence), documents are sorted directly by 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑞, 𝑑) in descending order.\nBy discretizing confidence into three intervals, LCR reduces noise and sharpens distinctions between documents.\n4. Evaluation and Discussion\nThis section provides a thorough evaluation of the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR) algorithm, assessing its\nperformance, robustness, and underlying mechanisms. We start with the experimental setup in §4.1, outlining the\ndatasets, retrievers, rerankers, confidence quantification methods, and evaluation metrics employed. § 4.2 then presents\nthe primary experimental results, comparing NDCG@5 scores across different configurations with BM25 as the\ninitial retriever. The subsequent subsection analyzes the impact of different retrievers, incorporating Contriever\nto evaluate compatibility. Additional analyses examine the effects of the query threshold, sensitivity to document\nthresholds, variations in language models, and different confidence quantification approaches. Finally, we investigate\nthe underlying mechanism of the LCR algorithm, as detailed in §4.8.\n4.1. Experiment Setup\n4.1.1. Datasets\nWe evaluate our approach on datasets from two prominent information retrieval benchmarks: BEIR (Thakur et\nal., 2021) and TREC (Voorhees & Harman, 2005). BEIR (Benchmarking IR) is a heterogeneous zero-shot evaluation\nbenchmark comprising datasets across diverse domains, designed to assess the generalization of retrieval models in out-\nof-domain settings. TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) is an annual series organized by NIST, providing standardized\ntasks and judgments for advancing retrieval research; we specifically use the Deep Learning tracks from 2019 and\n2020, which focus on passage ranking with graded relevance annotations. From BEIR, we select six datasets spanning\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 8 of 21\n"}, {"page": 9, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nTable 1\nComparison of Reranking Methods.\nReranker\nRequires Internal Param.\nBase Model\nArchitecture Type\nFine-tuned\nLCR (ours)\nNo\nQwen7B\nDecoder-Only\nNo\nQLM\nYes\nQwen7B\nDecoder-Only\nNo\nRankGPT\nNo\nQwen7B\nDecoder-Only\nNo\nYesNo\nYes\nQwen7B\nDecoder-Only\nNo\nCross-Encoder\nNo\nBERT-base\nEncoder-Only\nYes\nColBERT\nNo\nBERT-base\nEncoder-Only\nYes\nRankT5\nNo\nT5-base\nEncoder-Decoder\nYes\nvarious query types and relevance challenges, ideal for testing real-world retrieval performance in knowledge-intensive\ntasks:\n• NaturalQuestions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019): An open-domain question-answering dataset with real user\nqueries from Google search, annotated with answers from Wikipedia passages.\n• DBpedia-Entity (DBPE) (Hasibi et al., 2017): An entity-centric retrieval dataset emphasizing entity linking and\nknowledge graph queries, with relevance based on DBpedia entity relationships.\n• FEVER (FEVE) (Thorne et al., 2018): A fact verification dataset where queries are claims verified against\nWikipedia documents; relevance labels denote support, refutation, or neutrality.\n• SciDocs (SCID) (Cohan et al., 2020): A citation prediction dataset using scientific paper abstracts as queries,\nwith relevance determined by citation links.\n• Touché (TOUC) (Bondarenko et al., 2020): An argument retrieval dataset featuring debate topics as queries,\nwith relevance tied to supporting or opposing arguments in web documents.\n• NFCorpus (NFCO) (Boteva et al., 2016): A biomedical information retrieval dataset with medical queries and\nscientific articles, where expert-assigned labels indicate document relevance.\nFrom TREC, we incorporate two datasets:\n• TREC DL19 (DL19) (Craswell et al., 2020): Passage ranking task from TREC 2019 Deep Learning track, with\nqueries and graded relevance judgments on a large corpus.\n• TREC DL20 (DL20) (Craswell et al., 2021): Similar to DL19 but from the 2020 track, emphasizing neural\nretrieval methods with diverse query-document pairs.\nWe utilize the test sets and relevance annotations provided by these benchmarks.\n4.1.2. Retrievers and Rerankers\nWe employ BM25 (Jones et al., 2000) as a classic sparse retriever based on term frequency and inverse document\nfrequency, and Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) as a dense retriever enhanced by contrastive learning. These\nretrievers are selected to evaluate LCR’s compatibility across both sparse and dense retrieval paradigms, ensuring\na comprehensive assessment of its plug-and-play nature in diverse RAG settings.\nFor rerankers, we select a diverse set including pre-trained LLM-based and fine-tuned Transformer-based methods\nto benchmark LCR’s performance, as summarized in Table 1. These rerankers are:\n• QLM (Sachan et al., 2022): A point-wise reranking approach that prompts pre-trained language models to\ngenerate a relevant query for each candidate document, then ranks based on the likelihood of the actual query,\nwithout fine-tuning.\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 9 of 21\n"}, {"page": 10, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\n• RankGPT (Sun et al., 2023): A generative list-wise reranking method that prompts pre-trained language models\nto output a ranked list of document labels by relevance, using sliding windows, without fine-tuning.\n• YesNo (Qin et al., 2024): A point-wise reranking technique that prompts pre-trained language models to generate\n“yes” or “no” indicating document relevance to the query, then ranks based on normalized “yes” likelihood,\nwithout fine-tuning.\n• Cross-Encoder (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019): A cross-encoder method that computes relevance scores from\njoint query-document representations.\n• ColBERT (Khattab & Zaharia, 2020): A context embedding-based reranking model that enhances precision\nthrough token-level interactions.\n• RankT5 (Zhuang et al., 2023): A Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model designed for reranking tasks.\nThese rerankers are chosen to compare LCR—a training-free, confidence-based method—against both similar pre-\ntrained LLM-based approaches (e.g., QLM, RankGPT, YesNo) that underutilize semantic understanding, and fine-\ntuned Transformer models that represent optimized, domain-specific baselines, thereby highlighting LCR’s advantages\nin generalization and efficiency.\nFor each query, the retriever fetches top-10 documents, reranked by the specified method, including LCR. For\nLLM-based rerankers, we use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen7B) (A. Yang et al., 2024). We employ MSCP, as detailed\nin Equation 1, for confidence quantification.\n4.1.3.

Evaluation Metrics\nWe use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) (Järvelin & Kekäläinen, 2002) at 𝑘= 5 as the primary\nmetric, prioritizing relevant documents early for RAG systems.\nNDCG@k evaluates ranking quality by accounting for document relevance and position.

Higher NDCG@k values indicate superior performance,\nprioritizing relevant documents early.\n4.2. Experiment Results\nTable 2 presents the NDCG@5 performance comparison when using BM25 as the initial retriever, combined\nwith various rerankers, and further enhanced by LCR across datasets. As a plug-and-play algorithm based on LLM\nconfidence signals, LCR ensures a safe performance lower bound: when the query confidence threshold 𝑇query = 0,\nthe algorithm reverts to the original ranking, maintaining performance at least at the baseline level in the worst case.\nThis design provides high robustness for LCR in practical deployment, avoiding potential risks. The values in the table\nrepresent the best performance after tuning the three hyperparameters (𝑇query, 𝑇upper, 𝑇lower), aimed at demonstrating\nLCR’s upper potential; subsequent sensitivity analysis in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 will further validate its generalization\nability.\nThe improvements from LCR exhibit high consistency: across all reranker and dataset combinations, adding LCR\nresults in NDCG@5 gains or ties, with no instances of decline. This arises from LCR’s core mechanism: through\nconfidence binning, it prioritizes high-confidence documents at the top, while retaining the original ranking when query\nconfidence is high to avoid unnecessary interference. The averages across BEIR and TREC datasets indicate relative\ngains of up to 20.6% (e.g., YesNo on BEIR: 0.1737 to 0.2095) from LCR, with no declines. This stable enhancement\nconfirms the hypothesis that LLM confidence correlates positively with document relevance (detailed in Section 4.8).\nFrom the perspective of dataset heterogeneity, LCR’s gains are particularly notable on factual or argumentative\ndatasets (e.g., NaturalQuestions, Touché, FEVER), such as RankGPT on NaturalQuestions improving from 0.0489\nto 0.0587 (a 20% relative increase). This reflects that such queries heavily rely on semantic consistency from\nexternal documents, where LCR’s confidence signals effectively amplify relevance differences. On domain-specific\ndatasets with already high baseline performance (e.g., FEVER + fine-tuned Transformer-based rerankers), LCR\nmaintains stability without degradation, demonstrating its adaptability. For TREC datasets (DL19 and DL20), LCR’s\nimprovements are equally reliable, for instance, from 0.5172 to 0.5271 (a 1.9% relative increase) when applying LCR\ndirectly without any reranker. The document diversity and long-tail query characteristics of TREC datasets further\nhighlight LCR’s generalization advantage in handling complex retrieval scenarios.\nBreaking down by reranker type reveals LCR’s strong compatibility. First, in the pure BM25 Retriever-Only\nscenario, LCR yields average gains of 3.0% (BEIR) and 1.9% (TREC), with slight optimizations across all datasets,\nproving it can independently improve sparse retrieval results without relying on additional rerankers. This makes it\nespecially suitable for resource-constrained settings. Second, for pre-trained LLM-based rerankers (YesNo, QLM,\nRankGPT, using 7B-parameter models), baseline performance is often below or close to Retriever-Only (BEIR average\n0.1737–0.2391), reflecting limitations in ranking ability for small-scale models; however, LCR significantly reverses\nthis disadvantage, such as a 20.6% average gain on BEIR for YesNo. This suggests that even with limited model scale,\nthe core semantic understanding can capture document “helpfulness” through confidence signals, thereby amplifying\nranking effects. Finally, for fine-tuned Transformer-based rerankers (ColBERT, Cross-Encoder, RankT5), LCR’s gains\nare smaller (about 1%), but highly consistent. This verifies LCR’s good compatibility with domain-specific training,\nallowing further refinement of document relevance on high-performance baselines.\nIn summary, as a training-free and lightweight (7B-parameter) algorithm, LCR reliably enhances document\nrelevance in RAG systems, with an average gain of about 3% across methods and datasets, thereby reducing\nhallucination risks. Its lower-bound guarantee and plug-and-play nature make it particularly suitable for production-\nlevel knowledge-intensive tasks.\n4.3. Impact of Different Retrievers\nTo assess LCR’s compatibility with diverse retrievers, we employ Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) as an additional\ninitial retriever, which leverages contrastive learning to improve dense retrieval. Table 3 presents the NDCG@5 scores\nfor Contriever combined with various rerankers, both with and without LCR enhancement (where “+LCR w/o QT”\ndenotes LCR applied without the query threshold, and “+LCR” includes the query threshold; the impact of QT is\ndiscussed in §4.4).\nThe results indicate that LCR delivers consistent improvements over the Contriever baseline: across all reranker-\ndataset combinations, LCR achieves NDCG@5 gains or maintains equivalence, with no degradation. LCR achieves\nrelative gains of up to 32.4% on BEIR and TREC datasets, e.g., from 0.2281 to 0.3021 in the YesNo group (BEIR).\nRelative to BM25, Contriever exhibits a stronger baseline (BEIR average: 0.3939 vs. 0.2392); nevertheless, LCR’s\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 11 of 21\n"}, {"page": 12, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nTable 2\nComparative Performance of BM25 with Various Rerankers and LCR Enhancement.

On datasets with high baselines, such as FEVER, LCR preserves stability without excessive intervention.\nIn conclusion, LCR performs robustly with both BM25 and Contriever, yielding an average 3.6% gain and confirming\nits plug-and-play adaptability across sparse and dense retrieval paradigms.\n4.4. Impact of Query Threshold\nTo assess the impact of the query threshold (QT) on LCR performance, we first examine the results in Table 3,\nwhich contrasts “+LCR w/o QT” and “+LCR” (with QT) across rerankers using Contriever as the retriever. On average,\n“+LCR” achieves higher scores on both BEIR and TREC (e.g., 0.3998 vs. 0.3962 for Retriever-Only on BEIR, 0.5845\nvs. 0.5842 on TREC). These patterns indicate that QT further enhances LCR’s ranking performance across various\nrerankers. Specifically, when the LLM exhibits low confidence in a query, indicating limited internal knowledge of\nthe answer, it can more effectively distinguish helpful documents, leading to stronger confidence signals and greater\ngains from LCR. Conversely, high query confidence suggests the LLM already knows the answer, resulting in weaker\nsignals for document helpfulness differentiation. Thus, QT enables selective application of LCR to queries where it\nprovides the most benefit.\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 12 of 21\n"}, {"page": 13, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\nTable 3\nComparative Performance of Contriever with Various Rerankers and LCR Enhancement.

Figure 3 shows NDCG@5 scores for QT values from\n0.1 to 1.0, with QT=0 as the baseline (no LCR). For Retriever-Only and RankGPT, which rely on pre-trained LLMs and\nhave weaker baselines, NDCG@5 rises progressively with QT, peaking at QT=1.0, as higher QT applies LCR to more\nqueries for amplified gains. In contrast, RankT5 and Cross-Encoder, as fine-tuned rerankers with stronger baselines,\nexhibit an initial increase followed by a slight decline, requiring only slight QT adjustments. This suggests that higher\nQT benefits simpler rerankers by broadening confidence utilization, while advanced rerankers need minimal tuning to\navoid unnecessary interference. Overall, optimal QT selection can significantly improve ranking in RAG systems.\n4.5. Sensitivity Analysis of Document Thresholds\nTo assess the sensitivity of the document thresholds in the LCR algorithm, we employed the BM25 retriever\ncombined with the RankGPT reranker, without the query threshold, and produced a heatmap illustrating NDCG@5\nimprovement percentages as a function of the lower threshold (LT) and upper threshold (UT). As shown in Figure 4,\nranking performance exhibits consistent enhancements across valid combinations of LT (0.1 to 0.9) and UT (0.2\nto 1.0). Improvements intensify with higher UT values, peaking at UT=0.9. Gains are relatively modest when LT\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 13 of 21\n"}, {"page": 14, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nQuery Threshold\n0.049\n0.050\n0.051\n0.052\n0.053\n0.054\n0.055\n0.056\n0.057\nNDCG@5\nw/o LCR (QT=0)\n(a) Retriever-Only\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nQuery Threshold\n0.050\n0.052\n0.054\n0.056\nNDCG@5\nw/o LCR (QT=0)\n(b) RankGPT\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nQuery Threshold\n0.0831\n0.0832\n0.0833\n0.0834\n0.0835\n0.0836\n0.0837\n0.0838\nNDCG@5\nw/o LCR (QT=0)\n(c) RankT5\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nQuery Threshold\n0.0812\n0.0813\n0.0814\n0.0815\n0.0816\nNDCG@5\nw/o LCR (QT=0)\n(d) Cross-Encoder\nFigure 3: Query Threshold Impact on NDCG@5 for NaturalQuestions with BM25 Retriever.

Impact of Different Language Models\nTo evaluate the effect of various large language models (LLMs) on the performance of the LCR algorithm, we tested\nfour lightweight pre-trained models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen7B) (A. Yang et al., 2024), Llama3.1-8B-Instruct\n(Llama8B) (Dubey et al., 2024), GLM-4-9B-Chat (GLMChat9B) (Zeng et al., 2024), and InternLM2.5-7B-Chat\n(InternLM7B) (Cai et al., 2024). These models were selected due to their parameter sizes ranging from 7 to 9 billion,\nrepresenting diverse architectures and training corpora, which allows us to assess the generalizability of LCR across\ndifferent LLM families. We employed the MSCP method for confidence quantification. Experiments were conducted\non the NaturalQuestions dataset, employing BM25 and Contriever as retrievers, consistent with the main experimental\nsetup. As shown in Figure 5, InternLM7B yields the highest NDCG@5 improvements across all configurations, such\nas 24.5% for BM25 + RankGPT and 9.6% for Contriever + RankGPT. GLMChat9B follows closely, while Qwen7B\nshows the least gains. These results indicate that model selection substantially influences confidence signal quality, with\nInternLM7B providing the strongest semantic understanding for reranking enhancement. Notably, all tested 7–9B-scale\nmodels consistently yield performance improvements, demonstrating that LCR is robust and generalizes well across\nspecific model choices.\n4.7. Impact of Different Confidence Quantification Methods\nTo examine the effects of diverse confidence quantification approaches on the LCR algorithm, we performed\nexperiments on the NaturalQuestions dataset, utilizing BM25 and Contriever as initial retrievers.

Underlying Mechanism\nTo elucidate the effectiveness of the LCR algorithm, we hypothesize that the confidence exhibited by LLMs\nin their generated responses positively correlates with the relevance of the input documents. This hypothesis is\nempirically validated through experiments conducted on six diverse datasets. We employ the MSCP for confidence\nquantification. For each query-document pair, confidence scores are computed and uniformly divided into 10 bins.\nSubsequently, we calculate the proportion of relevant documents within each bin to reveal the confidence-relevance\nassociation. To ensure consistent comparison, relevance scores are binarized across all datasets: scores greater than 0\nare classified as relevant (1), while 0 denotes irrelevance (0). This binarization applies directly to datasets with binary\nrelevance (NaturalQuestions, FEVER, SciDocs) and requires converting graded scores—treating values greater than 0\nas relevant—for those with multi-level relevance (DBpedia-Entity, Touché, NFCorpus). As illustrated in Figure 7, the\nmajority of datasets demonstrate a clear positive correlation, wherein bins with higher confidence scores encompass\nlarger proportions of relevant documents. This indicates that LLMs exhibit greater semantic consistency in responses\ninformed by relevant documents, thereby generating more robust confidence signals that bolster LCR’s ranking\nenhancements through confidence binning.\nIn summary, this empirical validation highlights the utility of LLMs’ intrinsic semantic capabilities in document\nranking, providing a theoretical foundation for the application of LCR in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we addressed the persistent challenge of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) for\nknowledge-intensive tasks by introducing the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play\nalgorithm that harnesses LLMs’ semantic understanding and question-answering capabilities to enhance document\nreranking in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Unlike conventional rerankers that directly evaluate\nquery-document relevance, LCR leverages black-box LLM confidence signals—quantified via the Maximum Semantic\nCluster Proportion (MSCP)—as a proxy for relevance, employing a two-stage process of confidence assessment and\nmulti-level sorting to prioritize relevant documents.\nLCR demonstrates remarkable robustness across diverse settings, including various retrievers (sparse like BM25\nand dense like Contriever), rerankers (pre-trained LLM-based and fine-tuned Transformer-based), and LLMs from\ndifferent families. Relying solely on lightweight pre-trained models with 7–9B parameters, it ensures computational\nSong et al.: Preprint submitted to Elsevier\nPage 16 of 21\n"}, {"page": 17, "text": "LLM-Confidence Reranker\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\nNQ\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\nFEVER\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\nDBpedia-Entity\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nTouché\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\nSciDocs\n0.0-0.1\n0.1-0.2\n0.2-0.3\n0.3-0.4\n0.4-0.5\n0.5-0.6\n0.6-0.7\n0.7-0.8\n0.8-0.9\n0.9-1.0\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nNFCorpus\nConfidence Score Bins\nProportion of Relevant Samples\nFigure 7: Confidence-Relevance Calibration Curve.
